<p class="subchap">FROM THE THIRTY YEARS’ TRUCE, FOURTEEN YEARS
BEFORE THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR, DOWN TO THE BLOCKADE OF POTIDÆA, IN THE
YEAR BEFORE THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR.</p>

<p class="mt1">Personal activity now prevalent among the Athenian
citizens — empire of Athens again exclusively maritime, after the
Thirty years’ truce. — Chios, Samos, and Lesbos, were now the
only free allies of Athens, on the same footing as the original
confederates of Delos — the rest were subject and tributary. —
Athens took no pains to inspire her allies with the idea of a common
interest — nevertheless, the allies were gainers by the continuance
of her empire. — Conception of Periklês — Athens, an imperial
city, owing protection to the subject-allies; who, on their part,
owed obedience and tribute. — Large amount of revenue laid by and
accumulated by Athens, during the years preceding the Peloponnesian
war. — Pride felt by Athenian citizens in the imperial power of
their city. — Numerous Athenian citizens planted out as kleruchs by
Periklês. — Chersonesus of Thrace. Sinôpê. — Active personal and
commercial relations between Athens and all parts of the Ægean.
— Amphipolis in Thrace founded by Athens. — Agnon is sent out as
Œkist. — Situation and importance of Amphipolis. — Foundation, by the
Athenians, of Thurii, on the southern coast of Italy. — Conduct of
the refugee inhabitants of the ruined Sybaris — their encroachments
in the foundation of Thurii: they are expelled, and Thurii
reconstituted. — Herodotus and Lysias — both domiciliated as citizens
at Thurii. Few Athenian citizens settled there as colonists. — Period
from 445-431 <small>B.C.</small> Athens at peace. Her political
condition. Rivalry of Periklês with Thucydidês son of Melêsias. —
Points of contention between the two parties: 1. Peace with Persia.
2. Expenditure of money for the decoration of Athens. — Defence of
Periklês perfectly good against his political rivals. — Pan-Hellenic
schemes and sentiment of Periklês. — Bitter contention of parties at
Athens — vote of ostracism<span class="pagenum" id="Page_iv">[p.
iv]</span> — Thucydidês is ostracized about 443 <small>B.C.</small>
— New works undertaken at Athens. Third Long Wall. Docks in Peiræus
— which is newly laid out as a town, by the architect Hippodamus.
— Odeon, Parthenon, Propylæa. Other temples. Statues of Athênê. —
Illustrious artists and architects — Pheidias, Iktînus, Kallikratês.
— Effect of these creations of art and architecture upon the minds
of contemporaries. — Attempt of Periklês to convene a general
congress at Athens, of deputies from all the Grecian states. —
Revolt of Samos from the Athenians. — Athenian armament against
Samos, under Periklês, Sophoklês the tragedian, etc. — Doubtful and
prolonged contest — great power of Samos — it is at last reconquered,
disarmed, and dismantled. — None of the other allies of Athens,
except Byzantium, revolted at the same time. — Application of the
Samians to Sparta for aid against Athens — it is refused, chiefly
through the Corinthians. — Government of Samos after the reconquest
— doubtful whether the Athenians renewed the democracy which they
had recently established. — Funeral oration pronounced by Periklês
upon the Athenian citizens slain in the Samian war. — Position of
the Athenian empire — relation of Athens to her subject allies —
their feelings towards her generally were those of indifference and
acquiescence, not of hatred. — Particular grievances complained of
in the dealing of Athens with her allies. — Annual tribute — changes
made in its amount. Athenian officers and inspectors throughout the
empire. — Disputes and offences in and among the subject-allies,
were brought for trial before the dikasteries at Athens. Productive
of some disadvantages, but of preponderance of advantage to the
subject-allies themselves. — Imperial Athens compared with imperial
Sparta. — Numerous Athenian citizens spread over the Ægean — the
allies had no redress against them, except through the Athenian
dikasteries. — The dikasteries afforded protection against misconduct
both of Athenian citizens and Athenian officers. — The dikasteries,
defective or not, were the same tribunals under which every Athenian
held his own security. — Athenian empire was affected for the worse
by the circumstances of the Peloponnesian war: more violence was
introduced into it by that war than had prevailed before. — The
subject-allies of Athens had few practical grievances to complain of.
— The Grecian world was now divided into two great systems; with a
right supposed to be vested in each, of punishing its own refractory
members. — Policy of Corinth, from being pacific, becomes warlike.
— Disputes arise between Corinth and Korkyra — case of Epidamnus. —
The Epidamnians apply for aid in their distress to Korkyra; they are
refused — the Corinthians send aid to the place. — The Korkyræans
attack Epidamnus — armament sent thither by Corinth. — Remonstrance
of the Korkyræans with Corinth and the Peloponnesians. — Hostilities
between Corinth and Korkyra — naval victory of the latter. — Large
preparations made by Corinth for renewing the war. — Application of
the Korkyræans to be received among the allies of Athens. — Address
of the Korkyræan envoys to the Athenian public assembly. Principal
topics upon which it insists, as given in Thucydidês. — Envoys from
Corinth address the Athenian assembly in reply. — Decision of the
Athenians — a qualified compliance with the request of Korkyra.
The Athenian triremes sent to Korkyra. — Naval combat between the
Corinthians and Korkyræans: rude tactics on both sides. — The
Korkyræans are defeated. — Arrival of a reinforcement from Athens
— the Corinthian fleet retires, carrying off numerous Korkyræan
prisoners. — Hostilities not yet professedly begun between Athens
and Corinth. — Hatred conceived by the Corinthians towards Athens.
— They begin to stir up revolt among the Athenian allies — Potidæa,
colony of Corinth, but ally of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_v">[p.
v]</span> Athens. — Relations of Athens with Perdikkas king of
Macedonia, his intrigues along with Corinth against her — he induces
the Chalkidians to revolt from her — increase of Olynthus. — Revolt
of Potidæa — armament sent thither from Athens. — Combat near
Potidæa, between the Athenian force and the allied Corinthians.
Potidæans, and Chalkidians. — Victory of the Athenians. — Potidæa
placed in blockade by the Athenians.</p>

<p class="subchap">FROM THE BLOCKADE OF POTIDÆA DOWN TO THE END OF
THE FIRST YEAR OF THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR.</p>

<p class="mt1">State of feeling in Greece between the Thirty years’
truce and the Peloponnesian war — recognized probability of war —
Athens at that time not encroaching — decree interdicting trade
with the Megarians. — Zealous importunity of the Corinthians in
bringing about a general war, for the purpose of preserving Potidæa.
— Relations of Sparta with her allies — they had a determining vote,
whether they would or would not approve of a course of policy which
had been previously revived by Sparta separately. — Assembly of
the Spartans separately addressed by envoys of the allied powers,
complaining that Athens had violated the truce. — The Corinthian
envoys address the assembly last, after the envoys of the other
allies have inflamed it against Athens. — International customs of
the time, as bearing upon the points in dispute between Athens and
Corinth. — Athens in the right. — Tenor of the Corinthian address
— little allusion to recent wrong — strong efforts to raise hatred
and alarm against Athens. — Remarkable picture drawn of Athens by
her enemies. — Reply made by an Athenian envoy, accidentally present
in Sparta. — His account of the empire of Athens — how it had been
acquired, and how it was maintained. — He adjures them not to break
the truce, but to adjust all differences by that pacific appeal which
the truce provided. — The Spartans exclude strangers, and discuss
the point among themselves in the assembly. — Most Spartan speakers
are in favor of war. King Archidamus opposes war. His speech. — The
speech of Archidamus is ineffectual. Short, but warlike appeal of the
Ephor Stheneläidas. — Vote of the Spartan assembly in favor of war. —
The Spartans send to Delphi — obtain an encouraging reply. — General
congress of allies at Sparta. Second speech of the Corinthian envoys,
enforcing the necessity and propriety of war. — Vote of the majority
of the allies in favor of war, <small>B.C.</small>
432. — Views and motives of the opposing powers. — The hopes and
confidence, on the side of Sparta; the fears, on the side of Athens.
Heralds sent from Sparta to Athens with complaints and requisitions
meanwhile the preparations for war go on. — Requisitions addressed
by Sparta to Athens — demand for the expulsion of the Alkmæonidæ
as impious — aimed at Periklês. — Position of Periklês at Athens:
bitter hostility of his political opponents: attacks made upon him. —
Prosecution of Aspasia. Her character and accomplishments. — Family
relations of Periklês — his connection with Aspasia. License of the
comic writers in their attacks upon both. — Prosecution of Anaxagoras
the philosopher as well as of Aspasia — Anaxagoras retires from
Athens — Periklês defends Aspasia before the dikastery, and obtains
her acquittal.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[p. vi]</span> —
Prosecution of the sculptor Pheidias for embezzlement — instituted by
the political opponents of Periklês. — Charge of peculation against
Periklês himself. — Probability that Periklês was never even tried
for peculation, certainly that he was never found guilty of it. —
Requisition from the Lacedæmonians, for the banishment of Periklês
— arrived when Periklês was thus pressed by his political enemies
— rejected. — Counter-requisition sent by the Athenians to Sparta,
for expiation of sacrilege. — Fresh requisitions sent from Sparta
to Athens — to withdraw the troops from Potidæa — to leave Ægina
free — to readmit the Megarians to Athenian harbors. — Final and
peremptory requisition of Sparta — public assembly held at Athens on
the whole subject of war and peace. — Great difference of opinion in
the assembly — important speech of Periklês. — Periklês strenuously
urges the Athenians not to yield. — His review of the comparative
forces, and probable chances of success or defeat, in the war.
— The assembly adopts the recommendation of Periklês — firm and
determined reply sent to Sparta. — Views of Thucydidês respecting
the grounds, feelings, and projects of the two parties now about to
embark in war. — Equivocal period — war not yet proclaimed — first
blow struck, not by Athens, but by her enemies. — Open violation
of the truce by the Thebans — they surprise Platæa in the night. —
The gates of Platæa are opened by an oligarchical party within — a
Theban detachment are admitted into the agora at night — at first
apparently successful, afterwards overpowered and captured. — Large
force intended to arrive from Thebes to support the assailants early
in the morning — they are delayed by the rain and the swelling of
the Asôpus — they commence hostilities against the Platæan persons
and property without the walls. — Parley between the Platæans and
the Theban force without — the latter evacuate the territory — the
Theban prisoners in Platæa are slain. — Messages from Platæa to
Athens — answer. — Grecian feeling, already predisposed to the war,
was wound up to the highest pitch by the striking incident at Platæa.
— Preparations for war on the part of Athens — intimations sent round
to her allies — Akarnanians recently acquired by Athens as allies —
recent capture of the Amphilochian Argos by the Athenian Phormio.
— Strength and resources of Athens and her allies — military and
naval means — treasure. — Ample grounds for the confidence expressed
by Periklês in the result. — Position and power of Sparta and the
Peloponnesian allies — they are full of hope and confidence of
putting down Athens speedily. — Efforts of Sparta to get up a naval
force. — Muster of the combined Peloponnesian force at the isthmus
of Corinth, under Archidamus, to invade Attica. — Last envoy sent to
Athens — he is dismissed without being allowed to enter the town.
— March of Archidamus into Attica — his fruitless siege of Œnoê. —
Expectation of Archidamus that Athens would yield at the last moment.
— Difficulty of Periklês in persuading the Athenians to abandon
their territory and see it all ravaged. — Attica deserted — the
population flock within the walls of Athens. Hardships, privations,
and distress endured. — March of Archidamus into Attica. — Archidamus
advances to Acharnæ, within seven miles of Athens. — Intense clamor
within the walls of Athens — eagerness to go forth and fight. —
Trying position, firmness, and sustained ascendency, of Periklês,
in dissuading them from going forth. — The Athenians remain within
their walls: partial skirmishes only, no general action. — Athenian
fleet is despatched to ravage the coasts of Peloponnesus — first
notice of the Spartan Brasidas — operations of the Athenians in
Akarnania, Kephallênia, etc. — The Athenians expel the Æginetans from
Ægina, and people the island with Athenian kleruchs. The Ægi<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">[p. vii]</span>netans settle at Thyrea
in Peloponnesus. — The Athenians invade and ravage the Megarid:
sufferings of the Megarians. — Measures taken by Athens for permanent
defence. — Sum put by in the acropolis, against urgent need, not to
be touched unless under certain defined dangers. — Capital punishment
against any who should propose otherwise. — Remarks on this decree.
— Blockade of Potidæa — Sitalkês king of the Odrysian Thracians —
alliance made between him and Athens. — Periklês is chosen orator
to deliver the funeral discourse over the citizens slain during
the year. — Funeral oration of Periklês. — Sketch of Athenian
political constitution, and social life, as conceived by Periklês.
— Eulogy upon Athens and the Athenian character. — Mutual tolerance
of diversity of tastes and pursuits in Athens. — It is only true
partially and in some memorable instances that the state interfered
to an exorbitant degree with individual liberty in Greece. — Free
play of individual taste and impulse in Athens — importance of this
phenomenon in society. — Extraordinary and many-sided activity of
Athens. — Peculiar and interesting moment at which the discourse of
Periklês was delivered. Athens now at the maximum of her power —
declining tendency commences soon afterwards.</p>

<p class="subchap">FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE SECOND YEAR DOWN TO THE
END OF THE THIRD YEAR OF THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR.</p>

<p class="mt1">Barren results of the operations during the first
year of war. — Second invasion of Attica by the Peloponnesians —
more spreading and ruinous than the first. — Commencement of the
pestilence or epidemic at Athens. — Description of the epidemic by
Thucydidês — his conception of the duty of exactly observing and
recording. — Extensive and terrible suffering of Athens. — Inefficacy
of remedies — despair and demoralization of the Athenians. — Lawless
recklessness of conduct engendered. — Great loss of life among the
citizens — blow to the power of Athens. — Athenian armament sent
first against Peloponnesus, next, against Potidæa — it is attacked
and ruined by the epidemic. — Irritation of the Athenians under their
sufferings and losses — they become incensed against Periklês — his
unshaken firmness in defending himself. — Athenian public assembly —
last speech of Periklês — his high tone of self-esteem against the
public discontent. Powerful effect of his address — new resolution
shown for continuing the war — nevertheless, the discontent against
Periklês still continues. He is accused and condemned in a fine. —
Old age of Periklês — his family misfortunes and suffering. He is
reëlected stratêgus — restored to power and to the confidence of the
people. — Last moments and death of Periklês. His life and character.
— Judgment of Thucydidês respecting Periklês. — Earlier and later
political life of Periklês — how far the one differed from the other.
— Accusation against Periklês of having corrupted the Athenian
people — untrue, and not believed by Thucydidês. — Great progress

Athenian people were at this time ready for personal exertion in all
directions: military service on land or sea was not less conformable
to their dispositions than attendance in the ekklesia or in the
dikastery at home. The naval service especially was prosecuted with
a degree of assiduity which brought about continual improvement in
skill and efficiency, and the poorer citizens, of whom it chiefly
consisted, were more exact in obedience and discipline than any of
the more opulent persons from whom the infantry or the cavalry were
drawn.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
The maritime multitude, in addition to self-confi<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[p. 2]</span>dence and courage, acquired
by this laborious training an increased skill, which placed the
Athenian navy every year more and more above the rest of Greece: and
the perfection of this force became the more indispensable as the
Athenian empire was now again confined to the sea and seaport towns;
the reverses immediately preceding the thirty years truce having
broken up all Athenian land ascendency over Megara, Bœotia, and the
other continental territories adjoining to Attica.</p>

<p>The maritime confederacy,—originally commenced at Delos, under
the headship of Athens, but with a common synod and deliberative
voice on the part of each member,—had now become transformed into a
confirmed empire on the part of Athens, over the remaining states as
foreign dependencies; all of them rendering tribute except Chios,
Samos, and Lesbos. These three still remained on their original
footing of autonomous allies, retaining their armed force, ships, and
fortifications, with the obligation of furnishing military and naval
aid when required, but not of paying tribute: the discontinuance
of the deliberative synod, however, had deprived them of their
original security against the encroachments of Athens. I have
already stated generally the steps, we do not know them in detail,
whereby this important change was brought about, gradually and
without any violent revolution,—for even the transfer of the common
treasure from Delos to Athens, which was the most palpable symbol
and evidence of the change, was not an act of Athenian violence,
since it was adopted on the proposition of the Samians. The change
resulted in fact almost inevitably from the circumstances of the
case, and from the eager activity of the Athenians contrasted with
the backwardness and aversion to personal service on the part of the
allies. We must recollect that the confederacy, even in its original
structure, was contracted for permanent objects, and was permanently
binding by the vote of its majority, like the Spartan confederacy,
upon every individual member:<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2"
class="fnanchor">[2]</a> it was destined to keep out the Persian
fleet, and to maintain the police of the Ægean. Consistently with
these objects, no individual member could be allowed to secede
from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[p. 3]</span> the confederacy,
and thus to acquire the benefit of protection at the cost of the
remainder: so that when Naxos and other members actually did
secede, the step was taken as a revolt, and Athens only did her
duty as president of the confederacy in reducing them. By every
such reduction, as well as by that exchange of personal service for
money-payment, which most of the allies voluntarily sought, the
power of Athens increased, until at length she found herself with an
irresistible navy in the midst of disarmed tributaries, none of whom
could escape from her constraining power,—and mistress of the sea,
the use of which was indispensable to them. The synod of Delos, even
if it had not before become partially deserted, must have ceased at
the time when the treasure was removed to Athens,—probably about 460
<small>B.C.</small>, or shortly afterwards.</p>

<p>The relations between Athens and her allies were thus materially
changed by proceedings which gradually evolved themselves and
followed one upon the other without any preconcerted plan: she became
an imperial or despot city, governing an aggregate of dependent
subjects, all without their own active concurrence, and in many
cases doubtless contrary to their own sense of political right. It
was not likely that they should conspire unanimously to break up
the confederacy, and discontinue the collection of contribution
from each of the members: nor would it have been at all desirable
that they should do so: for while Greece generally would have been
a great loser by such a proceeding, the allies themselves would
have been the greatest losers of all, inasmuch as they would have
been exposed without defence to the Persian and Phenician fleets.
But the Athenians committed the capital fault of taking the whole
alliance into their own hands, and treating the allies purely as
subjects, without seeking to attach them by any form of political
incorporation or collective meeting and discussion,—without taking
any pains to maintain community of feeling with the idea of a joint
interest,—without admitting any control, real or even pretended,
over themselves as managers. Had they attempted to do this, it might
have proved difficult to accomplish,—so powerful was the force of
geographical dissemination, the tendency to isolated civic life,
and the repugnance to any permanent extramural obligations, in
every Grecian community: but they do not ap<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_4">[p. 4]</span>pear to have ever made the attempt.
Finding Athens exalted by circumstances to empire, and the allies
degraded into subjects, the Athenian statesmen grasped at the
exaltation as a matter of pride as well as profit:<a id="FNanchor_3"
href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> nor did even Periklês,
the most prudent and far-sighted of them, betray any consciousness
that an empire without the cement of some all-pervading interest or
attachment, must have a natural tendency to become more and more
burdensome and odious, and ultimately to crumble in pieces. Such was
the course of events which, if the judicious counsels of Periklês
had been followed, might have been postponed but could not have been
averted.</p>

<p>Instead of trying to cherish or restore the feelings of equal
alliance, Periklês formally disclaimed it. He maintained that Athens
owed to her subject allies no account of the money received from
them, so long as she performed her contract by keeping away the
Persian enemy, and maintaining the safety of the Ægean waters.<a
id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> This was,
as he represented, the obligation which Athens had undertaken; and,
provided it were faithfully discharged, the allies had no right to
ask questions or institute control. That it was faithfully discharged
no one could deny: no ship of war except that of Athens and her
allies was ever seen between the eastern and western shores of the
Ægean. An Athenian fleet of sixty triremes was kept on duty in these
waters, chiefly manned by Athenian citizens, and beneficial as well
from the protection afforded to commerce as for keeping the seaman
in constant pay and training.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5"
class="fnanchor">[5]</a> And such was the effective superintendence
maintained, that in the disastrous period preceding the thirty years’
truce, when Athens lost Megara and Bœotia, and with difficulty
recovered Eubœa, none of her numerous maritime subjects took the
opportunity to revolt.</p>

<p>The total of these distinct tributary cities is said to have
amounted to one thousand, according to a verse of Aristophanês,<a
id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> which
cannot be under the truth, though it may well be, and probably
is, greatly above the truth. The total annual tribute<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[p. 5]</span> collected at the
beginning of the Peloponnesian war, and probably also for the
years preceding it, is given by Thucydidês at about six hundred
talents; of the sums paid by particular states, however, we have
little or no information.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7"
class="fnanchor">[7]</a> It was placed under the superintendence
of the Hellenotamiæ; originally officers of the confederacy, but
now removed from Delos to Athens, and acting altogether as an
Athenian treasury-board. The sum total of the Athenian revenue,<a
id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
from all sources, including this tribute, at the beginning of
the Peloponnesian war, is stated by Xenophon at one thousand
talents: customs, harbor, and market dues, receipts from the
silver-mines at Laurium, rents of public property, fines from
judicial sentences, a tax per head upon slaves, the annual
payment made by each metic, etc., may have made up a larger sum
than four hundred talents; which sum, added to the six hundred
talents from tribute, would make the total named by Xenophon. But
a verse of Aristophanês,<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9"
class="fnanchor">[9]</a> during the ninth year of the Peloponnesian
war, <small>B.C.</small> 422, gives the general
total of that time as “nearly two thousand talents:” this<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[p. 6]</span> is in all probability
much above the truth, though we may well imagine that the amount of
tribute-money levied upon the allies may have been augmented during
the interval: I think that the alleged duplication of the tribute by
Alkibiadês, which Thucydidês nowhere notices, is not borne out by
any good evidence, nor can I believe that it ever reached the sum
of twelve hundred talents.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10"
class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Whatever may have been the actual magnitude
of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[p. 7]</span> Athenian
budget, however, prior to the Peloponnesian war, we know that during
the larger part of the administration of Peri<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_8">[p. 8]</span>klês, the revenue, including tribute, was
so managed as to leave a large annual surplus; insomuch that a
treasure of coined money was accumulated in the acropolis during the
years preceding the Peloponnesian war,—which treasure, when at its
maximum, reached the great sum of nine thousand seven hundred talents
(equal to two million two hundred and thirty thousand pounds), and
was still at six thousand talents, after a serious drain for various
purposes, at the moment when that war began.<a id="FNanchor_11"
href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> This system of public
economy, constantly laying by a considerable sum year after year,—in
which Athens stood alone, since none of the Peloponnesian states had
any public reserve whatever,<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12"
class="fnanchor">[12]</a>—goes far of itself to vindicate Periklês
from the charge of having wasted the public money in mischievous
distributions for the purpose of obtaining popularity; and also to
exonerate the Athenian Demos from that reproach of a greedy appetite
for living<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[p. 9]</span> by the
public purse which it is common to ascribe to them. After the
death of Kimon, no farther expeditions were undertaken against the
Persians, and even for some years before his death, not much appears
to have been done: so that the tribute-money remained unexpended,
though it was the duty of Athens to hold it in reserve against future
attack, which might at any time be renewed.</p>

<p>Though we do not know the exact amount of the other sources of
Athenian revenue, however, we know that the tribute received from
the allies was by far the largest item in it.<a id="FNanchor_13"
href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> And altogether the
exercise of empire abroad became a prominent feature in Athenian
life, and a necessity to Athenian sentiment, not less than democracy
at home. Athens was no longer, as she had been once, a single city,
with Attica for her territory: she was a capital or imperial city,—a
despot city, was the expression used by her enemies, and even
sometimes by her own citizens,<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14"
class="fnanchor">[14]</a>—with many dependencies attached to her,
and bound to follow her orders. Such was the manner in which not
merely Periklês and the other leading statesmen, but even the
humblest Athenian citizen, conceived the dignity of Athens; and
the sen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[p. 10]</span>timent
was one which carried with it both personal pride and stimulus
to active patriotism. To establish Athenian interests among the
dependent territories, was one important object in the eyes of
Periklês, and while he discountenanced all distant<a id="FNanchor_15"
href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> and rash enterprises,
such as invasions of Egypt or Cyprus, he planted out many kleruchies
and colonies of Athenian citizens, intermingled with allies, on
islands, and parts of the coast. He conducted one thousand citizens
to the Thracian Chersonese, five hundred to Naxos, and two hundred
and fifty to Andros. In the Chersonese, he farther repelled the
barbarous Thracian invaders from without, and even undertook the
labor of carrying a wall of defence across the isthmus, which
connected the peninsula with Thrace; since the barbarous Thracian
tribes, though expelled some time before by Kimon,<a id="FNanchor_16"
href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> had still continued to
renew their incursions from time to time. Ever since the occupation
of the elder Miltiadês, about eighty years before, there had been in
this peninsula many Athenian proprietors, apparently intermingled
with half-civilized Thracians: the settlers now acquired both
greater numerical strength and better protection, though it does not
appear that the cross-wall was permanently maintained. The maritime
expeditions of Periklês even extended into the Euxine sea, as far
as the important Greek city of Sinôpê, then governed by a despot
named Timesilaus, against whom a large proportion of the citizens
were in active discontent. He left Lamachus with thirteen Athenian
triremes to assist in expelling the despot, who was driven into
exile along with his friends and party: the properties of these
exiles were confiscated, and assigned to the maintenance of six
hundred Athenian citizens, admitted to equal fellowship and residence
with the Sinôpeans. We may presume that on this occasion Sinôpê
became a member of the Athenian tributary alliance, if it had not
been so before: but we do not know whether Kotyôra and Trapezus,
dependencies of Sinôpê, farther eastward, which the ten thousand
Greeks found on their retreat fifty years afterwards, existed in the
time of Periklês or not. Moreover, the numerous and well-equipped
Athenian fleet, under the command of Periklês, produced an imposing
effect upon the barbarous princes and tribes along the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[p. 11]</span> coast,<a id="FNanchor_17"
href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> contributing certainly
to the security of Grecian trade, and probably to the acquisition of
new dependent allies.</p>

<p>It was by successive proceedings of this sort that many
detachments of Athenian citizens became settled in various portions
of the maritime empire of the city,—some rich, investing their
property in the islands as more secure—from the incontestable
superiority of Athens at sea—even than Attica, which, since
the loss of the Megarid, could not be guarded against a
Peloponnesian land invasion,<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18"
class="fnanchor">[18]</a>—others poor, and hiring themselves
out as laborers.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19"
class="fnanchor">[19]</a> The islands of Lemnos, Imbros, and Skyros,
as well as the territory of Estiæa, on the north of Eubœa, were
completely occupied by Athenian proprietors and citizens,—other
places partially so occupied. And it was doubtless advantageous to
the islanders to associate themselves with Athenians in trading
enterprises, since they thereby obtained a better chance of the
protection of the Athenian fleet. It seems that Athens passed
regulations occasionally for the commerce of her dependent allies,
as we see by the fact, that shortly before the Peloponnesian war,
she excluded the Megarians from all their ports. The commercial
relations between Peiræus and the Ægean reached their maximum during
the interval immediately preceding the Peloponnesian war: nor were
these relations confined to the country east and north of Attica:
they reached also the western regions. The most important settlements
founded by Athens during this period were Amphipolis in Thrace, and
Thurii in Italy.</p>

<p>Amphipolis was planted by a colony of Athenians and other Greeks,
under the conduct of the Athenian Agnon, in 437 <small>B.C.</small>
It was situated near the river Strymon, in Thrace, on the eastern
bank, and at the spot where the Strymon resumes its river-course
after emerging from the lake above. It was originally a township
or settlement of the Edonian Thracians, called Ennea<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[p. 12]</span> Hodoi, or Nine Ways,—in
a situation doubly valuable, both as being close upon the bridge
over the Strymon, and as a convenient centre for the ship-timber
and gold and silver mines of the neighboring region,—and distant
about three English miles from the Athenian settlement of Eion at
the mouth of the river. The previous unsuccessful attempts to form
establishments at Ennea Hodoi have already been noticed,—first, that
of Histiæus the Milesian, followed up by his brother Aristagoras
(about 497-496 <small>B.C.</small>), next, that of the Athenians
about 465 <small>B.C.</small>, under Leagrus and others,—on both
these occasions the intruding settlers had been defeated and
expelled by the native Thracian tribes, though on the second
occasion the number sent by Athens was not less than ten thousand.<a
id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
So serious a loss deterred the Athenians for a long time from
any repetition of the attempt: though it is highly probable that
individual citizens from Eion and from Thasus connected themselves
with powerful Thracian families, and became in this manner actively
engaged in mining, to their own great profit,—as well as to the
profit of the city collectively, since the property of the kleruchs,
or Athenian citizens occupying colonial lands, bore its share in case
of direct taxes being imposed on Athenian property generally. Among
such fortunate adventurers we may number the historian Thucydidês
himself; seemingly descended from Athenian parents intermarrying
with Thracians, and himself married to a wife either Thracian or
belonging to a family of Athenian colonists in that region, through
whom he became possessed of a large property in the mines, as well
as of great influence in the districts around.<a id="FNanchor_21"
href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> This was one of the
various ways in which the collective power of Athens enabled her
chief citizens to enrich themselves individually.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[p. 13]</span></p>

<p>The colony under Agnon, despatched from Athens in the year 437
<small>B.C.</small>, appears to have been both numerous
and well sustained, inasmuch as it conquered and maintained the
valuable position of Ennea Hodoi in spite of those formidable
Edonian neighbors who had baffled the two preceding attempts. Its
name of Ennea Hodoi was exchanged for that of Amphipolis,—the hill
on which the new town was situated being bounded on three sides
by the river. The settlers seem to have been of mixed extraction,
comprising no large proportion of Athenians: some were of Chalkidic
race, others came from Argilus, a Grecian city colonized from
Andros, which possessed the territory on the western bank of the
Strymon, immediately opposite to Amphipolis,<a id="FNanchor_22"
href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> and which was included
among the subject allies of Athens. Amphipolis, connected with the
sea by the Strymon and the port of Eion, became the most important
of all the Athenian dependencies in reference to Thrace and
Macedonia.</p>

<p>The colony of Thurii on the coast of the gulf of Tarentum in
Italy, near the site and on the territory of the ancient Sybaris,
was founded by Athens about seven years earlier than Amphipolis, not
long after the conclusion of the thirty years’ truce with Sparta,
<small>B.C.</small> 443. Since the destruction of the old
Sybaris by the Krotoniates, in 509 <small>B.C.</small>,
its territory had for the most part remained unappropriated: the
descendants of the former inhabitants, dispersed at Laus and in other
portions of the territory, were not strong enough to establish any
new city; nor did it suit the views of the Krotoniates themselves
to do so. After an interval of more than sixty years, however,
during which one unsuccessful attempt at occupation had been made
by some Thessalian settlers, these Sybarites at length prevailed
upon the Athenians to undertake and protect the recolonization;
the proposition having been made in vain to the Spartans. Lampon
and Xenokritus, the former a prophet and interpreter of oracles,
were sent by Periklês with ten ships as chiefs of the new colony
of Thurii, founded under the auspices of Athens. The settlers were
collected from all parts of Greece, and included Dorians, Ionians,
islanders, Bœotians, as well as Athenians. But the descendants of the
ancient Sybarites procured themselves to be<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_14">[p. 14]</span> treated as privileged citizens, and
monopolized for themselves the possession of political powers, as
well as the most valuable lands in the immediate vicinity of the
walls; while their wives also assumed an offensive preëminence over
the other women of the city in the public religious processions. Such
spirit of privilege and monopoly appears to have been a frequent
manifestation among the ancient colonies, and often fatal either to
their tranquillity or to their growth; sometimes to both. In the case
of Thurii, founded under the auspices of the democratical Athens, it
was not likely to have any lasting success: and we find that after no
very long period, the majority of the colonists rose in insurrection
against the privileged Sybarites, either slew or expelled them, and
divided the entire territory of the city, upon equal principles,
among the colonists of every different race. This revolution enabled
them to make peace with the Krotoniates, who had probably been
unfriendly so long as their ancient enemies, the Sybarites, were
masters of the city, and likely to turn its powers to the purpose
of avenging their conquered ancestors. And the city from this time
forward, democratically governed, appears to have flourished steadily
and without internal dissension for thirty years, until the ruinous
disasters of the Athenians before Syracuse occasioned the overthrow
of the Athenian party at Thurii. How miscellaneous the population
of Thurii was, we may judge from the denominations of the ten
tribes,—such was the number of tribes established, after the model
of Athens,—Arkas, Achaïs, Eleia, Bœotia, Amphiktyonis, Doris, Ias,
Athenaïs, Euboïs, Nesiôtis. From this mixture of race they could
not agree in recognizing or honoring an Athenian œkist, or indeed
any œkist except Apollo.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23"
class="fnanchor">[23]</a> The Spartan general, Kleandridas, banished
a few years before for having suffered himself to be bribed by
Athens along with king Pleistoanax, removed to Thurii, and was
appointed general of the citizens in their war against Tarentum.
That war was ultimately adjusted by the joint foundation of the
new city of Herakleia, half-way between the two,—in the fertile
territory called Siritis.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24"
class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>The most interesting circumstance respecting Thurii is, that<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[p. 15]</span> the rhetor Lysias, and
the historian Herodotus, were both domiciliated there as citizens.
The city was connected with Athens, yet seemingly only by a feeble
tie; nor was it numbered among the tributary subject allies.<a
id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> From
the circumstance that so large a proportion of the settlers at Thurii
were not native Athenians, we may infer that there were not many of
the latter at that time who were willing to put themselves so far
out of connection with Athens,—even though tempted by the prospect
of lots of land in a fertile and promising territory. And Periklês
was probably anxious that those poor citizens for whom emigration
was desirable should become kleruchs in some of the islands or ports
of the Ægean, where they would serve—like the colonies of Rome—as
a sort of garrison for the insurance of the Athenian empire.<a
id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>The fourteen years between the thirty years’ truce and the
breaking out of the Peloponnesian war, are a period of full
maritime empire on the part of Athens,—partially indeed resisted,
but never with success. They are a period of peace with all cities
extraneous to her own empire; and of splendid decorations to the
city itself, from the genius of Pheidias and others, in sculpture
as well as in architecture. Since the death of Kimon, Periklês had
become more and more the first citizen in the commonwealth: his
qualities told for more the longer they were known, and even the
disastrous reverses which preceded the thirty years’ truce had not
overthrown him, since he had protested against that expedition of
Tolmidês into Bœotia out of which they first arose. But if the
personal influence of Periklês had increased, the party opposed to
him seems also to have become stronger and better organized than
it had been before; and to have acquired a leader in many respects
more effective than Kimon,—Thucydidês, son of Melêsias. The new
chief was a near relative of Kimon, but of a character and talents
more analogous to that of Periklês: a statesman and orator<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[p. 16]</span> rather than a general,
though competent to both functions if occasion demanded, as every
leading man in those days was required to be. Under Thucydidês, the
political and parliamentary opposition against Periklês assumed
a constant character and an organization such as Kimon, with his
exclusively military aptitudes, had never been able to establish.
The aristocratical party in the commonwealth,—the “honorable and
respectable” citizens, as we find them styled, adopting their
own nomenclature,—now imposed upon themselves the obligation of
undeviating regularity in their attendance on the public assembly,
sitting together in a particular section, so as to be conspicuously
parted from the Demos. In this manner, their applause and dissent,
their mutual encouragement to each other, their distribution of
parts to different speakers, was made more conducive to the party
purposes than it had been before, when these distinguished persons
had been intermingled with the mass of citizens.<a id="FNanchor_27"
href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> Thucydidês himself
was eminent as a speaker, inferior only to Periklês,—perhaps hardly
inferior even to him. We are told that in reply to a question
put to him by Archidamus, whether Periklês or he were the better
wrestler, Thucydidês replied: “Even when I throw him, he denies
that he has fallen, gains his point, and talks over those who have
actually seen him fall.”<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28"
class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>Such an opposition made to Periklês, in all the full license
which a democratical constitution permitted, must have been both
efficient and embarrassing; but the pointed severance of the
aristocratical chiefs, which Thucydidês, son of Melêsias, introduced,
contributed probably at once to rally the democratical majority round
Periklês, and to exasperate the bitterness of party-conflict.<a
id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> As
far as we can make out the grounds of the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_17">[p. 17]</span> opposition, it turned partly upon the
pacific policy of Periklês towards the Persians, partly upon his
expenditure for home ornament. Thucydidês contended that Athens
was disgraced in the eyes of the Greeks, by having drawn the
confederate treasure from Delos to her own acropolis, under pretence
of greater security, and then employing it, not in prosecuting
war against the Persians,<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30"
class="fnanchor">[30]</a> but in beautifying Athens by new temples
and costly statues. To this Periklês replied, that Athens had
undertaken the obligation, in consideration of the tribute-money, to
protect her allies and keep off from them every foreign enemy,—that
she had accomplished this object completely at the present, and
retained a reserve sufficient to guarantee the like security for
the future;—that, under such circumstances, she owed no account to
her allies of the expenditure of the surplus, but was at liberty
to expend it for purposes useful and honorable to the city. In
this point of view it was an object of great public importance to
render Athens imposing in the eyes both of the allies and of Hellas
generally, by improved fortifications,—by accumulated ornaments,
sculptural and architectural,—and by religious festivals,—frequent,
splendid, musical, and poetical.</p>

<p>Such was the answer made by Periklês in defence of his policy
against the opposition headed by Thucydidês. And as far as we can
make out the ground taken by both parties, the answer was perfectly
satisfactory. For when we look at the very large sum which Periklês
continually kept in reserve in the treasury, no one could reasonably
complain that his expenditure for ornamental purposes was carried so
far as to encroach upon the exigences of defence. What Thucydidês
and his partisans appear to have urged, was, that this common fund
should still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[p. 18]</span>
continue to be spent in aggressive warfare against the Persian
king, in Egypt and elsewhere,—conformably to the projects pursued
by Kimon during his life.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31"
class="fnanchor">[31]</a> But Periklês was right in contending that
such outlay would have been simply wasteful; of no use either to
Athens or her allies, though risking all the chances of distant
defeat, such as had been experienced a few years before in Egypt.
The Persian force was already kept away, both from the waters of the
Ægean and the coast of Asia, either by the stipulations of the treaty
of Kallias, or—if that treaty be supposed apocryphal—by a conduct
practically the same as those stipulations would have enforced. The
<i>allies</i>, indeed, might have had some ground of complaint against
Periklês, either for not reducing the amount of tribute required from
them, seeing that it was more than sufficient for the legitimate
purposes of the confederacy, or for not having collected their
positive sentiment as to the disposal of it. But we do not find that
this was the argument adopted by Thucydidês and his party, nor was it
calculated to find favor either with aristocrats or democrats, in the
Athenian assembly.</p>

<p>Admitting the injustice of Athens—an injustice common to both the
parties in that city, not less to Kimon than to Periklês—in acting
as despot instead of chief, and in discontinuing all appeal to the
active and hearty concurrence of her numerous allies, we shall
find that the schemes of Periklês were at the same time eminently
Pan-Hellenic. In strengthening and ornamenting Athens, in developing
the full activity of her citizens, in providing temples, religious
offerings, works of art, solemn festivals, all of surpassing
attraction,—he intended to exalt her into something greater than an
imperial city with numerous dependent allies. He wished to make her
the centre of Grecian feeling, the stimulus of Grecian intellect,
and the type of strong democratical patriotism combined with full
liberty of individual taste and aspiration. He wished not merely
to retain the adherence of the subject states, but to attract the
admiration and spontaneous deference of independent neighbors, so as
to procure for Athens a moral ascendency much beyond the range of
her direct power. And he succeeded in elevating the city to<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[p. 19]</span> a visible grandeur,<a
id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
which made her appear even much stronger than she really was,—and
which had the farther effect of softening to the minds of the
subjects the humiliating sense of obedience; while it served as a
normal school, open to strangers from all quarters, of energetic
action even under full license of criticism,—of elegant pursuits
economically followed,—and of a love for knowledge without enervation
of character. Such were the views of Periklês in regard to his
country, during the years which preceded the Peloponnesian war, as
we find them recorded in his celebrated Funeral Oration, pronounced
in the first year of that war,—an exposition forever memorable of
the sentiment and purpose of Athenian democracy, as conceived by its
ablest president.</p>

<p>So bitter, however, was the opposition made by Thucydidês and
his party to this projected expenditure,—so violent and pointed
did the scission of aristocrats and democrats become,—that the
dispute came after no long time to that ultimate appeal which the
Athenian constitution provided for the case of two opposite and
nearly equal party-leaders,—a vote of ostracism. Of the particular
details which preceded this ostracism, we are not informed; but we
see clearly that the general position was such as the ostracism
was intended to meet. Probably the vote was proposed by the party
of Thucydidês, in order to procure the banishment of Periklês, the
more powerful person of the two, and the most likely to excite
popular jealousy. The challenge was accepted by Periklês and his
friends, and the result of the voting was such that an adequate
legal majority condemned Thucydidês to ostracism.<a id="FNanchor_33"
href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> And it seems that
the majority must have been very decisive, for the party of
Thucydidês was completely broken by it: and we hear of no other
single individual equally formidable as a leader of opposition,
throughout all the remaining life of Periklês.</p> <p><span
class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[p. 20]</span></p> <p>The ostracism of
Thucydidês apparently took place about two years<a id="FNanchor_34"
href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> after the conclusion
of the thirty years’ truce,—443-442 <small>B.C.</small>,—and it
is to the period immediately following that the great Periklêan
works belong. The southern wall of the acropolis had been built
out of the spoils brought by Kimon from his Persian expeditions;
but the third of the long walls connecting Athens with the harbor
was the proposition of Periklês, at what precise time we do not
know. The long walls originally completed—not long after the
battle of Tanagra, as has already been stated—were two, one from
Athens to Peiræus, another from Athens to Phalêrum: the space
between them was broad, and if in the hands of an enemy, the
communication with Peiræus would be interrupted. Accordingly,
Periklês now induced the people to construct a third or intermediate
wall, running parallel with the first wall to Peiræus, and
within a short distance<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35"
class="fnanchor">[35]</a>—seemingly near one furlong—from it: so that
the communication between the city and the port was placed beyond
all possible interruption, even assuming an enemy to have got within
the Phaleric wall. It was seemingly about this time, too, that the
splendid docks and arsenal in Peiræus, alleged by Isokratês to have
cost one thousand talents, were constructed:<a id="FNanchor_36"
href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> while the town itself
of Peiræus was laid out anew with straight streets intersecting at
right angles. Apparently, this was something new in Greece,—the
towns generally, and Athens itself in particular, having been
built without any symmetry, or width, or continuity of streets:<a
id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
and Hippodamus the Milesian, a man of considerable attainments in
the physical philosophy of the age, derived much renown as the
earliest town architect, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[p.
21]</span> having laid out the Peiræus on a regular plan. The
market-place, or one of them at least, permanently bore his
name,—the Hippodamian agora.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38"
class="fnanchor">[38]</a> At a time when so many great architects
were displaying their genius in the construction of temples, we
are not surprised to hear that the structure of towns began to be
regularized also: moreover, we are told that the new colonial town of
Thurii, to which Hippodamus went as a settler, was also constructed
in the same systematic form as to straight and wide streets.<a
id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>The new scheme upon which the Peiræus was laid out, was not
without its value as one visible proof of the naval grandeur of
Athens. But the buildings in Athens and on the acropolis formed the
real glory of the Periklêan age. A new theatre, termed the Odeon,
was constructed for musical and poetical representations at the
great Panathenaic solemnity; next, the splendid temple of Athênê,
called the Parthenon, with all its masterpieces of decorative
sculpture and reliefs; lastly, the costly portals erected to adorn
the entrance of the acropolis, on the western side of the hill,
through which the solemn processions on festival days were conducted.
It appears that the Odeon and the Parthenon were both finished
between 445 and 437 <small>B.C.</small>: the Propylæa somewhat later,
between 437 and 431 <small>B.C.</small>, in which latter year the
Peloponnesian war began.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40"
class="fnanchor">[40]</a> Progress was also made in restoring
or reconstructing the Erechtheion, or ancient temple of Athênê
Polias, the patron goddess of the city,—which had been burnt in
the invasion of Xerxes; but the breaking out of the Peloponnesian
war seems to have prevented the completion of this, as well as of
the great temple of Dêmêter, at Eleusis, for the celebration of
the Eleusinian mysteries,—that of Athênê, at Sunium,—and that of
Nemesis, at Rhamnus. Nor was the sculpture less memorable than the
architecture: three statues of Athênê, all by the hand of Pheidias,
decorated the acropolis,—one colossal, forty-seven feet high, of
ivory, in the Parthenon,<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41"
class="fnanchor">[41]</a>—a second of bronze, called the Lemnian
Athênê,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[p. 22]</span>—a third of
colossal magnitude, also in bronze, called Athênê Promachos, placed
between the Propylæa and the Parthenon, and visible from afar off,
even to the navigator approaching Peiræus by sea.</p>

<p>It is not, of course, to Periklês that the renown of these
splendid productions of art belongs: but the great sculptors and
architects by whom they were conceived and executed, belonged to
that same period of expanding and stimulating Athenian democracy
which called forth a similar creative genius in oratory, in dramatic
poetry, and in philosophical speculation. One man especially, of
immortal name,—Pheidias,—born a little before the battle of Marathon,
was the original mind in whom the sublime ideal conceptions of
genuine art appear to have disengaged themselves from that hardness
of execution and adherence to a consecrated type, which marked the
efforts of his predecessors.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42"
class="fnanchor">[42]</a> He was the great director and
superintendent of all those decorative additions whereby Periklês
imparted to Athens a majesty such as had never before belonged to
any Grecian city: the architects of the Parthenon and the other
buildings—Iktînus, Kallikratês, Korœbus, Mnesiklês, and others—worked
under his superintendence: and he had, besides, a school of pupils
and subordinates to whom the mechanical part of his labors was
confided. With all the great additions which Pheidias made to the
grandeur of Athens, his last and greatest achievement was out of
Athens,—the colossal statue of Zeus, in the great temple of Olympia,
executed in the years immediately preceding the Peloponnesian war.
The effect produced by this stupendous work, sixty feet high, in
ivory and gold, embodying in visible majesty some of the grandest
conceptions of Grecian poetry and religion, upon the minds of all
beholders for many centuries successively,—was such as never has
been, and probably never will be, equalled in the annals of art,
sacred or profane.</p>

<p>Considering these prodigious achievements in the field of
art only as they bear upon Athenian and Grecian history, they
are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[p. 23]</span> phenomena of
extraordinary importance. When we read the profound impression which
they produced upon Grecian spectators of a later age, we may judge
how immense was the effect upon that generation which saw them both
begun and finished. In the year 480 <small>B.C.</small>, Athens had
been ruined by the occupation of Xerxes: since that period, the
Greeks had seen, first, the rebuilding and fortifying of the city
on an enlarged scale,—next, the addition of Peiræus with its docks
and magazines,—thirdly, the junction of the two by the long walls,
thus including the most numerous concentrated population, wealth,
arms, ships, etc., in Greece,<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43"
class="fnanchor">[43]</a>—lastly, the rapid creation of so many new
miracles of art,—the sculptures of Pheidias as well as the paintings
of the Thasian painter, Polygnôtus, in the temple of Theseus, and
in the portico called Pœkilê. Plutarch observes<a id="FNanchor_44"
href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> that the celerity with
which the works were completed was the most remarkable circumstance
connected with them; and so it probably might be, in respect to
the effect upon the contemporary Greeks. The gigantic strides by
which Athens had reached her maritime empire were now immediately
succeeded by a series of works which stamped her as the imperial
city of Greece, gave to her an appearance of power even greater
than the reality, and especially put to shame the old-fashioned
simplicity of Sparta.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45"
class="fnanchor">[45]</a> The cost was doubtless prodigious, and
could only have been borne at a time when there was a large treasure
in the acropolis, as well as a considerable tribute annually coming
in: if we may trust a computation which seems to rest on plausible
grounds, it cannot have been much less than three thousand talents in
the aggregate,—about six hundred and ninety thousand pounds.<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[p. 24]</span><a id="FNanchor_46"
href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> The expenditure of so
large a sum was, of course, the source of great private gain to the
contractors, tradesmen, merchants, artisans of various descriptions,
etc., concerned in it: in one way or another, it distributed itself
over a large portion of the whole city. And it appears that the
materials employed for much of the work were designedly of the most
costly description, as being most consistent with the reverence
due to the gods: marble was rejected as too common for the statue
of Athênê, and ivory employed in its place;<a id="FNanchor_47"
href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> while the gold with
which it was surrounded weighed not less than forty talents.<a
id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> A
large expenditure for such purposes, considered as pious towards
the gods, was at the same time imposing in reference to Grecian
feeling, which regarded with admiration every variety of public show
and magnificence, and repaid by grateful deference the rich men who
indulged in it. Periklês knew well that the visible splendor of
the city, so new to all his contemporaries, would cause her great
real power to appear even greater than its reality, and would thus
procure for her a real, though unacknowledged influence—perhaps even
an ascendency—over all cities of the Grecian name. And it is certain
that even among those who most hated and feared her, at the outbreak
of the Peloponnesian war, there prevailed a powerful sentiment of
involuntary deference.</p>

<p>A step taken by Periklês, apparently not long after the
commencement of the thirty years’ truce, evinces how much this
ascendency was in his direct aim, and how much he connected it
with views both of harmony and usefulness for Greece generally.
He prevailed upon the people to send envoys to every city of the
Greek name, great and small, inviting each to appoint deputies for
a congress to be held at Athens. Three points were to be discussed
in this intended congress. 1. The restitution of those temples
which had been burnt by the Persian invaders. 2. The fulfilment of
such vows, as on that occasion had been made to the gods. 3. The
safety of the sea and of maritime commerce for all. Twenty elderly
Athenians were sent round<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[p.
25]</span> to obtain the convocation of this congress at Athens,—a
Pan-Hellenic congress for Pan-Hellenic purposes. But those who were
sent to Bœotia and Peloponnesus completely failed in their object,
from the jealousy, noway astonishing, of Sparta and her allies: of
the rest we hear nothing, for this refusal was quite sufficient to
frustrate the whole scheme.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49"
class="fnanchor">[49]</a> It is to be remarked that the dependent
allies of Athens appear to have been summoned just as much as the
cities perfectly autonomous; so that their tributary relation to
Athens was not understood to degrade them. We may sincerely regret
that such congress did not take effect, as it might have opened
some new possibilities of converging tendency and alliance for the
dispersed fractions of the Greek name,—a comprehensive benefit, to
which Sparta was at once incompetent and indifferent, but which
might, perhaps, have been realized under Athens, and seems in this
case to have been sincerely aimed at by Periklês. The events of
the Peloponnesian war, however, extinguished all hopes of any such
union.</p>

<p>The interval of fourteen years, between the beginning of the
thirty years’ truce and that of the Peloponnesian war, was by no
means one of undisturbed peace to Athens. In the sixth year of that
period occurred the formidable revolt of Samos.</p>

<p>That island appears to have been the most powerful of all
the allies of Athens,<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50"
class="fnanchor">[50]</a>—more powerful even than Chios or Lesbos,
and standing on the same footing as the two latter; that is,
paying no tribute-money,—a privilege when compared with the body
of the allies,—but furnishing ships and men when called upon, and
retaining, subject to this condition, its complete autonomy, its
oligarchical government, its fortifications, and its military
force. Like most of the other islands near the coast, Samos<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[p. 26]</span> possessed a portion
of territory on the mainland, between which and the territory of
Milêtus, lay the small town of Priênê, one of the twelve original
members contributing to the Pan-Ionic solemnity. Respecting the
possession of this town of Priênê, a war broke out between the
Samians and Milesians, in the sixth year of the thirty years’
truce (<small>B.C.</small> 440-439): whether the town
had before been independent, we do not know, but in this war the
Milesians were worsted, and it fell into the hands of the Samians.
The defeated Milesians, enrolled as they were among the tributary
allies of Athens, complained to her of the conduct of the Samians,
and their complaint was seconded by a party in Samos itself opposed
to the oligarchy and its proceedings. The Athenians required the
two disputing cities to bring the matter before discussion and
award at Athens, with which the Samians refused to comply:<a
id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
whereupon an armament of forty ships was despatched from Athens
to the island, and established in it a democratical government;
leaving in it a garrison, and carrying away to Lemnos fifty men and
as many boys from the principal oligarchical families, to serve as
hostages. Of these families, however, a certain number retired to
the mainland, where they entered into negotiations with Pissuthnês,
the satrap of Sardis, to procure aid and restoration. Obtaining from
him seven hundred mercenary troops, and passing over in the night to
the island, by previous concert with the oligarchical party, they
overcame the Samian democracy as well as the Athenian garrison,
who were sent over as prisoners to Pissuthnês. They were farther
lucky enough to succeed in stealing away from Lemnos their own
recently deposited hostages, and they then proclaimed open revolt
against Athens, in which Byzantium also joined. It seems re<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[p. 27]</span>markable, that though, by
such a proceeding, they would of course draw upon themselves the full
strength of Athens, yet their first step was to resume aggressive
hostilities against Milêtus,<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52"
class="fnanchor">[52]</a> whither they sailed with a powerful naval
force of seventy ships, twenty of them carrying troops aboard.</p>

<p>Immediately on the receipt of this grave intelligence, a
fleet of sixty triremes—probably all that were in complete
readiness—was despatched to Samos under ten generals, two of whom
were Periklês himself and the poet Sophoklês,<a id="FNanchor_53"
href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> both seemingly included
among the ten ordinary stratêgi of the year. But it was necessary
to employ sixteen of these ships, partly in summoning contingents
from Chios and Lesbos, to which islands Sophoklês went in person;<a
id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
partly in keeping watch off the coast of Karia for the arrival of
the Phenician fleet, which report stated to be approaching; so that
Periklês had only forty-four ships remaining in his squadron. Yet
he did not hesitate to attack the Samian fleet of seventy ships
on its way back from Milêtus, near the island of Tragia, and was
victorious in the action. Presently, he was reinforced by forty
ships from Athens, and by twenty-five from Chios and Lesbos, so
as to be able to disembark at Samos, where he overcame the Samian
land-force, and blocked up the harbor with a portion of his fleet,
surrounding the city on the land-side with a triple wall. Meanwhile,
the Samians had sent Stesagoras with five ships to press the coming
of the Phenician fleet, and the report of their approach became
again so prevalent that Periklês felt obliged to take sixty ships,
out of the total one hundred and twenty-five, to watch for them off
the coast of Kaunus and Karia, where he remained for about fourteen
days. The Phenician fleet<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55"
class="fnanchor">[55]</a> never came, though Diodorus affirms that it
was actually on its voyage.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[p.
28]</span> Pissuthnês certainly seems to have promised, and the
Samians to have expected it: but I incline to believe that, though
willing to hold out hopes and encourage revolt among the Athenian
allies, the satrap, nevertheless, did not choose openly to violate
the convention of Kallias, whereby the Persians were forbidden to
send a fleet westward of the Chelidonian promontory. The departure
of Periklês, however, so much weakened the Athenian fleet off
Samos, that the Samians, suddenly sailing out of their harbor in an
opportune moment, at the instigation and under the command of one
of their most eminent citizens, the philosopher Melissus,—surprised
and ruined the blockading squadron, and gained a victory over the
remaining fleet, before the ships could be fairly got out to sea.<a
id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> For
fourteen days they remained masters of the sea, carrying in and
out all that they thought proper: nor was it until the return of
Periklês that they were again blocked up. Reinforcements, however,
were now multiplied to the blockading squadron,—from Athens, forty
ships, under Thucydidês,<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57"
class="fnanchor">[57]</a> Agnon, and Phormion, and twenty under
Tlepole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[p. 29]</span>mus and
Antiklês, besides thirty from Chios and Lesbos,—making altogether
near two hundred sail. Against this overwhelming force, Melissus
and the Samians made an unavailing attempt at resistance, but were
presently quite blocked up, and remained so for nearly nine months,
until they could hold out no longer. They then capitulated, being
compelled to raze their fortifications, to surrender all their ships
of war, to give hostages for future good conduct, and to make good
by stated instalments the whole expense of the enterprise, said to
have reached one thousand talents. The Byzantines, too, made their
submission at the same time.<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58"
class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>Two or three circumstances deserve notice respecting this revolt,
as illustrating the existing condition of the Athenian empire.
First, that the whole force of Athens, together with the contingents
from Chios and Lesbos, was necessary in order to crush it, so that
even Byzantium, which joined in the revolt, seems to have been left
unassailed. Now, it is remarkable that none of the dependent allies
near Byzantium, or anywhere else, availed themselves of so favorable
an opportunity to revolt also: a fact which seems plainly to imply
that there was little positive discontent then prevalent among them.
Had the revolt spread to other cities, probably Pissuthnês might have
realized his promise of bringing in the Phenician fleet, which would
have been a serious calamity for the Ægean Greeks, and was only kept
off by the unbroken maintenance of the Athenian empire.</p>

<p>Next, the revolted Samians applied for aid, not only to
Pissuthnês, but also to Sparta and her allies; among whom, at
a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[p. 30]</span> special meeting,
the question of compliance or refusal was formally debated.
Notwithstanding the thirty years’ truce then subsisting, of which
only six years had elapsed, and which had been noway violated by
Athens,—many of the allies of Sparta voted for assisting the Samians:
what part Sparta herself took, we do not know,—but the Corinthians
were the main and decided advocates for the negative. They not only
contended that the truce distinctly forbade compliance with the
Samian request, but also recognized the right of each confederacy
to punish its own recusant members, and this was the decision
ultimately adopted, for which the Corinthians afterwards took credit,
in the eyes of Athens, as the chief authors.<a id="FNanchor_59"
href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> Certainly, if the
contrary policy had been pursued, the Athenian empire might have been
in great danger, the Phenician fleet would probably have been brought
in also, and the future course of events might have been greatly
altered.</p>

<p>Again, after the reconquest of Samos, we should assume it almost
as a matter of certainty, that the Athenians would renew the
democratical government which they had set up just before the revolt.
Yet, if they did so, it must have been again overthrown, without
any attempt to uphold it on the part of Athens. For we hardly hear
of Samos again, until twenty-seven years afterwards, towards the
latter division of the Peloponnesian war, in 412 <small>B.C.</small>,
and it then appears with an established oligarchical government of
geomori, or landed proprietors, against which the people make a
successful rising during the course of that year.<a id="FNanchor_60"
href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> As Samos remained,
during the interval between 439 <small>B.C.</small> and 412
<small>B.C.</small>, unfortified, deprived of its fleet, and enrolled
among the tribute-paying allies of Athens,—and as it, nevertheless,
either retained or acquired its oligarchical government; so we
may conclude that Athens cannot have systematically interfered to
democratize by violence the subject-allies, in cases where the
natural tendency of parties ran towards oligarchy. The condition
of Lesbos at the time of its revolt, hereafter to be related,
will be found to confirm this conclusion.<a id="FNanchor_61"
href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[p. 31]</span></p>

<p>On returning to Athens after the reconquest of Samos, Periklês
was chosen to pronounce the funeral oration over the citizens
slain in the war, to whom, according to custom, solemn and public
obsequies were celebrated in the suburb called Kerameikus. This
custom appears to have been introduced shortly after the Persian
war,<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>
and would doubtless contribute to stimulate the patriotism of
the citizens, especially when the speaker elected to deliver it
was of the personal dignity as well as the oratorical powers of
Periklês. He was twice public funeral orator by the choice of the
citizens: once after the Samian success, and a second time in the
first year of the Peloponnesian war. His discourse on the first
occasion has not reached us,<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63"
class="fnanchor">[63]</a> but the second has been fortunately
preserved, in substance at least, by Thucydidês, who also briefly
describes the funeral ceremony,—doubtless the same on all occasions.
The bones of the deceased warriors were exposed in tents three days
before the ceremony, in order that the relatives of each might
have the opportunity of bringing offerings: they were then placed
in coffins of cypress, and carried forth on carts to the public
burial-place at the Kerameikus; one coffin for each of the ten
tribes, and one empty couch, formally laid out, to represent those
warriors whose bones had not been discovered or collected. The female
relatives of each followed the carts, with loud wailings, and after
them a numerous procession both of citizens and strangers. So soon
as the bones had been consigned to the grave, some distinguished
citizen,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[p. 32]</span> specially
chosen for the purpose, mounted an elevated stage, and addressed to
the multitude an appropriate discourse. Such was the effect produced
by that of Periklês after the Samian expedition, that, when he had
concluded, the audience present testified their emotion in the
liveliest manner, and the women especially crowned him with garlands,
like a victorious athlete.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64"
class="fnanchor">[64]</a> Only Elpinikê, sister of the deceased
Kimon, reminded him that the victories of her brother had been more
felicitous, as gained over Persians and Phenicians, and not over
Greeks and kinsmen. And the contemporary poet Ion, the friend of
Kimon, reported what he thought an unseemly boast of Periklês,—to the
effect that Agamemnon had spent ten years in taking a foreign city,
while <i>he</i> in nine months had reduced the first and most powerful of
all the Ionic communities.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65"
class="fnanchor">[65]</a> But if we possessed the actual speech
pronounced, we should probably find that he assigned all the honor
of the exploit to Athens and her citizens generally, placing their
achievement in favorable comparison with that of Agamemnon and his
host,—not himself with Agamemnon.</p>

<p>Whatever may be thought of this boast, there can be no doubt
that the result of the Samian war not only rescued the Athenian
empire from great peril,<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66"
class="fnanchor">[66]</a> but rendered it stronger than ever:
while the foundation of Amphipolis, which was effected two years
afterwards, strengthened it still farther. Nor do we hear, during the
ensuing few years, of any farther tendencies to disaffection among
its members, until the period immediately before the Peloponnesian
war. The feeling common among them towards Athens, seems to have
been neither attachment nor hatred, but simple indifference and
acquiescence in her supremacy. Such amount of positive discontent
as really existed among them, arose, not from actual hardships
suffered, but from the general political instinct of the Greek
mind,—desire of separate auto<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[p.
33]</span>nomy for each city; which manifested itself in each,
through the oligarchical party, whose power was kept down by
Athens, and was stimulated by the sentiment communicated from the
Grecian communities without the Athenian empire. According to that
sentiment, the condition of a subject-ally of Athens was treated
as one of degradation and servitude: and in proportion as fear and
hatred of Athens became more and more predominant among the allies
of Sparta, they gave utterance to the sentiment more and more
emphatically, so as to encourage discontent artificially among the
subject-allies of the Athenian empire. Possessing complete mastery
of the sea, and every sort of superiority requisite for holding
empire over islands, Athens had yet no sentiment to appeal to in
her subjects, calculated to render her empire popular, except that
of common democracy, which seems at first to have acted without
any care on her part to encourage it, until the progress of the
Peloponnesian war made such encouragement a part of her policy.
And had she even tried sincerely to keep up in the allies the
feeling of a common interest, and the attachment to a permanent
confederacy, the instinct of political separation would probably
have baffled all her efforts. But she took no such pains,—with the
usual morality that grows up in the minds of the actual possessors
of power, she conceived herself entitled to exact obedience as her
right; and some of the Athenian speakers in Thucydidês go so far
as to disdain all pretence of legitimate power, even such as might
fairly be set up, resting the supremacy of Athens on the naked
plea of superior force.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67"
class="fnanchor">[67]</a> As the allied cities were mostly under
democracies,—through the indirect influence rather than the
systematic dictation of Athens,—yet each having its own internal
aristocracy in a state of opposition; so the movements for revolt
against Athens originated with the aristocracy or with some few
citizens apart: while the people, though sharing more or less in the
desire for autonomy, had yet either a fear of their own aristocracy
or a sympathy with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[p. 34]</span>
Athens, which made them always backward in revolting, sometimes
decidedly opposed to it. Neither Periklês nor Kleon, indeed, lay
stress on the attachment of the people as distinguished from that
of the Few, in these dependent cities; but the argument is strongly
insisted on by Diodorus,<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68"
class="fnanchor">[68]</a> in the discussion respecting Mitylênê after
its surrender: and as the war advanced, the question of alliance with
Athens or Sparta became more and more identified with the internal
preponderance of democracy or oligarchy in each.<a id="FNanchor_69"
href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> We shall find that
in most of those cases of actual revolt where we are informed of
the preceding circumstances, the step is adopted or contrived by a
small number of oligarchical malcontents, without consulting the
general voice; while in those cases where the general assembly is
consulted beforehand, there is manifested indeed a preference for
autonomy, but nothing like a hatred of Athens or decided inclination
to break with her. In the case of Mitylênê,<a id="FNanchor_70"
href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> in the fourth year of
the war, it was the aristocratical government which revolted, while
the people, as soon as they obtained arms, actually declared in
favor of Athens: and the secession of Chios, the greatest of all the
allies, in the twentieth year of the Peloponnesian war, even after
all the hardships which the allies had been called upon to bear in
that war, and after the ruinous disasters which Athens had sustained
before Syracuse,—was both prepared beforehand and accomplished by
secret negotiations of the Chian oligarchy, not only without the
concurrence, but against the inclination, of their own people.<a
id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
In like manner, the revolt of Thasos would not have occurred,
had not the Thasian democracy been previ<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_35">[p. 35]</span>ously subverted by the Athenian Peisander
and his oligarchical confederates. So in Akanthus, in Amphipolis,
in Mendê, and those other Athenian dependencies which were wrested
from Athens by Brasidas, we find the latter secretly introduced by
a few conspirators, while the bulk of the citizens do not hail him
at once as a deliverer, like men sick of Athenian supremacy: they
acquiesce, not without debate, when Brasidas is already in the town,
and his demeanor, just as well as conciliating, soon gains their
esteem: but neither in Akanthus nor in Amphipolis would he have
been admitted by the free decision of the citizens, if they had not
been alarmed for the safety of their friends, their properties,
and their harvest, still exposed in the lands without the walls.<a
id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
These particular examples warrant us in affirming, that though the
oligarchy in the various allied cities desired eagerly to shake
off the supremacy of Athens, the people were always backward in
following them, sometimes even opposed, and hardly ever willing to
make sacrifices for the object. They shared the universal Grecian
desire for separate autonomy,<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73"
class="fnanchor">[73]</a> felt the Athenian empire as an extraneous
pressure which they would have been glad to shake off, whenever the
change could be made with safety: but their condition was not one
of positive hardship, nor did they overlook the hazardous side of
such a change,—partly from the coercive hand of Athens, partly from
new enemies against whom Athens had hitherto protected them, and not
least, from their own oligarchy. Of course, the different allied
cities were not all animated by the same feelings, some being more
averse to Athens than others.</p>

<p>The particular modes in which Athenian supremacy was felt as a
grievance by the allies appear to have been chiefly three. 1. The
annual tribute. 2. The encroachments, exactions, or perhaps plunder,
committed by individual Athenians, who would often take advantage of
their superior position, either as serving in the naval armaments, as
invested with the function of inspectors as placed in garrison, or as
carrying on some private speculation. 3. The obligation under which
the allies were placed, of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[p.
36]</span> bringing a large proportion of their judicial trials to be
settled before the dikasteries at Athens.</p>

<p>As to the tribute, I have before remarked that its amount had
been but little raised from its first settlement down to the
beginning of the Peloponnesian war, at which time it was six
hundred talents yearly:<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74"
class="fnanchor">[74]</a> it appears to have been reviewed, and the
apportionment corrected, in every fifth year, at which period the
collecting officers may probably have been changed; but we shall
afterwards find it becoming larger and more burdensome. The same
gradual increase may probably be affirmed respecting the second
head of inconvenience,—vexation caused to the allies by individual
Athenians, chiefly officers of armaments, or powerful citizens.<a
id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>
Doubtless this was always more or less a real grievance, from the
moment when the Athenians became despots in place of chiefs, but it
was probably not very serious in extent until after the commencement
of the Peloponnesian war, when revolt on the part of the allies
became more apprehended, and when garrisons, inspectors, and
tribute-gathering ships became more essential in the working of the
Athenian empire.</p>

<p>But the third circumstance above noticed—the subjection of
the allied cities to the Athenian dikasteries—has been more
dwelt upon as a grievance than the second, and seems to have
been unduly exaggerated. We can hardly doubt that the beginning
of this jurisdiction exercised by the Athenian dikasteries dates
with the synod of Delos, at the time of the first formation of the
confederacy. It was an indispensable element of that confederacy,
that the members should forego their right of private war among each
other, and submit their differences to peaceable arbitration,—a
covenant introduced even into alliances much less intimate than
this was, and absolutely essential to the efficient maintenance of
any common action against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[p.
37]</span> Persia.<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76"
class="fnanchor">[76]</a> Of course, many causes of dispute, public
as well as private, must have arisen among these wide-spread islands
and seaports of the Ægean, connected with each other by relations
of fellow-feeling, of trade, and of common apprehensions. The
synod of Delos, composed of the deputies of all, was the natural
board of arbitration for such disputes, and a habit must thus have
been formed, of recognizing a sort of federal tribunal,—to decide
peaceably how far each ally had faithfully discharged its duties,
both towards the confederacy collectively, and towards other allies
with their individual citizens separately,—as well as to enforce
its decisions and punish refractory members, pursuant to the right
which Sparta and her confederacy claimed and exercised also.<a
id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> Now
from the beginning, the Athenians were the guiding and enforcing
presidents of this synod, and when it gradually died away, they were
found occupying its place as well as clothed with its functions. It
was in this manner that their judicial authority over the allies
appears first to have begun, as the confederacy became changed
into an Athenian empire,—the judicial functions of the synod being
transferred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[p. 38]</span> along
with the common treasure to Athens, and doubtless much extended. And
on the whole, these functions must have been productive of more good
than evil to the allies themselves, especially to the weakest and
most defenceless among them.</p>

<p>Among the thousand towns which paid tribute to Athens,—taking this
numerical statement of Aristophanês, not in its exact meaning, but
simply as a great number,—if a small town, or one of its citizens,
had cause of complaint against a larger, there was no channel
except the synod of Delos, or the Athenian tribunal, through which
it could have any reasonable assurance of fair trial or justice.
It is not to be supposed that all the private complaints and suits
between citizen and citizen, in each respective subject town, were
carried up for trial to Athens: yet we do not know distinctly how
the line was drawn between matters carried up thither and matters
tried at home. The subject cities appear to have been interdicted
from the power of capital punishment, which could only be inflicted
after previous trial and condemnation at Athens:<a id="FNanchor_78"
href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> so that the latter
reserved to herself the cognizance of most of the grave crimes,—or
what may be called “the higher justice” generally. And the political
accusations preferred by citizen against citizen, in any subject
city, for alleged treason, corruption, non-fulfilment of public duty,
etc., were doubtless carried to Athens for trial,—perhaps the most
important part of her jurisdiction.</p>

<p>But the maintenance of this judicial supremacy was not intended
by Athens for the substantive object of amending the administration
of justice in each separate allied city: it went rather to regulate
the relations between city and city,—between citizens of different
cities,—between Athenian citizens or officers, and any of these
allied cities with which they had relations,—between each city
itself, as a dependent government with contending political parties,
and the imperial head, Athens. All these were problems which imperial
Athens was called on to solve, and the best way of solving them
would have been through some common synod emanating from all the
allies: putting this aside, we shall find that the solution provided
by Athens was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[p. 39]</span>
perhaps the next best, and we shall be the more induced to think
so, when we compare it with the proceedings afterwards adopted by
Sparta, when she had put down the Athenian empire. Under Sparta, the
general rule was, to place each of the dependent cities under the
government of a dekadarchy or oligarchical council of ten among its
chief citizens, together with a Spartan harmost, or governor, having
a small garrison under his orders. It will be found, when we come to
describe the Spartan maritime empire, that these arrangements exposed
each dependent city to very great violence and extortion, while,
after all, they solved only a part of the problem: they served only
to maintain each separate city under the dominion of Sparta, without
contributing to regulate the dealings between the citizens of one
and those of another, or to bind together the empire as a whole. Now
the Athenians did not, as a system, place in their dependent cities,
governors analogous to the harmosts, though they did so occasionally
under special need; but their fleets and their officers were in
frequent relation with these cities; and as the principal officers
were noways indisposed to abuse their position, so the facility of
complaint, constantly open to the Athenian popular dikastery, served
both as redress and guarantee against misrule of this description. It
was a guarantee which the allies themselves sensibly felt and valued,
as we know from Thucydidês: the chief source from whence they had to
apprehend evil was the Athenian officials and principal citizens,
who could misemploy the power of Athens for their own private
purposes,—but they looked up to the “Athenian Demos as a chastener
of such evil-doers and as a harbor of refuge to themselves.”<a
id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>
If<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[p. 40]</span> the popular
dikasteries at Athens had not been thus open, the allied cities would
have suffered much more severely from the captains and officials
of Athens in their individual capacity. And the maintenance of
political harmony, between the imperial city and the subject ally,
was insured by Athens through the jurisdiction of her dikasteries
with much less cost of injustice and violence than by Sparta; for
though oligarchical partisans might sometimes be unjustly condemned
at Athens, yet such accidental wrong was immensely overpassed by the
enormities of the Spartan harmosts and dekadarchies, who put numbers
to death without any trial at all.</p>

<p>So again, it is to be recollected that Athenian private citizens,
not officially employed, were spread over the whole range of the
empire as kleruchs, proprietors, or traders; of course, therefore,
disputes would arise between them and the natives of the subject
cities, as well as among these latter themselves, in cases where
both parties did not belong to the same city. Now in such cases the
Spartan imperial authority was so exercised as to afford little or
no remedy, since the action of the harmost or the dekadarchy was
confined to one separate city; while the Athenian dikasteries, with
universal competence and public trial, afforded the only redress
which the contingency admitted. If a Thasian citizen believed himself
aggrieved by the historian Thucydidês, either as commander of the
Athenian fleet off the station, or as proprietor of gold mines in
Thrace, he had his remedy against the latter<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_41">[p. 41]</span> by accusation before the Athenian
dikasteries, to which the most powerful Athenian was amenable not
less than the meanest Thasian. To a citizen of any allied city, it
might be an occasional hardship to be sued before the courts at
Athens, but it was also often a valuable privilege to him to be
able to sue before those courts others whom else he could not have
reached. He had his share both of the benefit and of the hardship.
Athens, if she robbed her subject-allies of their independence, at
least gave them in exchange the advantage of a central and common
judiciary authority; thus enabling each of them to enforce claims
of justice against the rest, in a way which would not have been
practicable, to the weaker at least, even in a state of general
independence.</p>

<p>Now Sparta seems not even to have attempted anything of the
kind with regard to her subject-allies, being content to keep
them under the rule of a harmost, and a partisan oligarchy; and
we read anecdotes which show that no justice could be obtained at
Sparta, even for the grossest outrages committed by the harmost,
or by private Spartans out of Laconia. The two daughters of a
Bœotian named Skedasus, of Leuktra in Bœotia, had been first
violated and then slain by two Spartan citizens: the son of a
citizen of Oreus, in Eubœa, had been also outraged and killed by
the harmost Aristodêmus:<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80"
class="fnanchor">[80]</a> in both cases the fathers went to Sparta to
lay the enormity before the ephors and other authorities, and in both
cases a deaf ear was turned to their complaints. But such crimes, if
committed by Athenian citizens or officers, might have been brought
to a formal exposure before the public sitting of the dikastery, and
there can be no doubt that both would have been severely punished: we
shall see hereafter that an enormity of this description, committed
by the Athenian general Pachês, at Mitylênê, cost him his life
before the Athenian dikasts.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81"
class="fnanchor">[81]</a> Xenophon, in the dark and one-sided
representation which he gives of the Athenian democracy, remarks,
that if the subject-allies had not been made amenable to justice, at
Athens, they would have cared little for the people of Athens, and
would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[p. 42]</span> have paid
court only to those individual Athenians—generals, trierarchs, or
envoys—who visited the islands on service; but under the existing
system, the subjects were compelled to visit Athens either as
plaintiffs or defendants, and were thus under the necessity of paying
court to the bulk of the people also,—that is, to those humbler
citizens out of whom the dikasteries were formed; they supplicated
the dikasts in court for favor or lenient dealing.<a id="FNanchor_82"
href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> However true this may
be, we must remark that it was a lighter lot to be brought for trial
before the dikastery, than to be condemned without redress by the
general on service, or to be forced to buy off his condemnation by
a bribe; and, moreover, that the dikastery was open not merely to
receive accusations against citizens of the allied cities, but also
to entertain the complaints which they preferred against others.</p>

<p>Assuming the dikasteries at Athens to be ever so defective as
tribunals for administering justice, we must recollect that they
were the same tribunals under which every Athenian citizen held
his own fortune or reputation, and that the native of any subject
city was admitted to the same chance of justice as the native
of Athens. Accordingly, we find the Athenian envoy at Sparta,
immediately before the Peloponnesian war, taking peculiar credit
to the imperial city on this ground for equal dealing with her
subject-allies. “If our power (he says) were to pass into other
hands, the comparison would presently show how moderate we are in
the use of it: but as regards us, our very moderation is unfairly
turned to our disparagement rather than to our praise. For even
though we put ourselves at disadvantage in matters litigated with our
allies, and though we have appointed such matters to be judged among
ourselves and under laws equal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[p.
43]</span> to both parties, we are represented as animated by
nothing better than a love of litigation.”<a id="FNanchor_83"
href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> “Our allies (he adds)
would com<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[p. 44]</span>plain
less if we made open use of our superior force with regard to
them; but we discard such maxims, and deal with them upon<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[p. 45]</span> an equal footing: and
they are so accustomed to this, that they think themselves entitled
to complain at every trifling disappointment of their expectations.<a
id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> They
suffered worse hardships under the Persians before our empire began,
and they would suffer worse under you (the Spartans), if you were
to succeed in conquering us and making our empire yours.” History
bears out the boast of the Athenian orator, both as to the time
preceding and following the empire of Athens.<a id="FNanchor_85"
href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> And an Athenian
citizen, indeed, might well regard it, not as a hardship, but as a
privilege, that subject-allies should be allowed to sue him before
the dikastery, and to defend themselves before the same tribunal,
either in case of wrong done to him, or in case of alleged treason
to the imperial authority of Athens: they were thereby put upon a
level with himself. Still more would he find reason to eulogize the
universal competence of these dikasteries in providing a common legal
authority for all disputes of the numerous distinct communities
of the empire, one with another, and for the safe navigation and
general commerce of the Ægean. That complaints were raised against
it among the subject-allies, is noway surprising: for the empire
of Athens generally was inconsistent with that separate autonomy
to which every town thought itself entitled,—and this was one of
its prominent and constantly operative institutions, as well as a
striking mark of dependence to the subordinate communities. Yet we
may safely affirm, that if empire was to be maintained at all, no way
of maintaining it could be found at once less oppressive and more
beneficial than the superintending competence of the dikasteries,—a
system not taking its rise in the mere “love of litigation,” if,
indeed, we are to reckon this a real feature in the Athenian
character, which I shall take another opportunity of examining, much
less in those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[p. 46]</span>
petty collateral interests indicated by Xenophon,<a id="FNanchor_86"
href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> such as the increased
customs duty, rent of houses, and hire of slaves at Peiræus, and
the larger profits of the heralds, arising from the influx of
suitors. It was nothing but the power, originally inherent in the
confederacy of Delos, of arbitration between members and enforcement
of duties towards the whole,—a power inherited by Athens from that
synod, and enlarged to meet the political wants of her empire; to
which end it was essential, even in the view of Xenophon himself.<a
id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> It
may be that the dikastery was not always impartial between Athenian
citizens privately, or the Athenian commonwealth collectively, and
the subject-allies,—and in so far the latter had good reason to
complain; but on the other hand, we have no ground for suspecting it
of deliberate or standing unfairness, or of any other defects than
such as were inseparable from its constitution and procedure, whoever
might be the parties under trial.</p>

<p>We are now considering the Athenian empire as it stood before
the Peloponnesian war; before the increased exactions and the
multiplied revolts, to which that war gave rise,—before the cruelties
which accompanied the suppression of those revolts, and which so
deeply stained the character of Athens,—before that aggravated
fierceness, mistrust, contempt of obligation, and rapacious violence,
which Thucydidês so emphatically indicates as having been infused
into the Greek bosom by the fever of an all-pervading contest.<a
id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> There
had been before this time many revolts of the Athenian dependencies,
from the earliest at Naxos down to the latest at Samos: all had been
successfully suppressed, but in no case had Athens displayed the same
unre<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[p. 47]</span>lenting rigor
as we shall find hereafter manifested towards Mitylênê, Skiônê, and
Mêlos. The policy of Periklês, now in the plenitude of his power at
Athens, was cautious and conservative, averse to forced extension of
empire as well as to those increased burdens on the dependent allies
which such schemes would have entailed, and tending to maintain that
assured commerce in the Ægean by which all of them must have been
gainers,—not without a conviction that the contest must arise sooner
or later between Athens and Sparta, and that the resources as well as
the temper of the allies must be husbanded against that contingency.
If we read in Thucydidês the speech of the envoy from Mitylênê<a
id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> at
Olympia, delivered to the Lacedæmonians and their allies in the
fourth year of the Peloponnesian war, on occasion of the revolt
of the city from Athens,—a speech imploring aid and setting forth
the strongest case against Athens which the facts could be made to
furnish,—we shall be surprised how weak the case is, and how much the
speaker is conscious of its weakness. He has nothing like practical
grievances and oppressions to urge against the imperial city,—he does
not dwell upon enormity of tribute, unpunished misconduct of Athenian
officers, hardship of bringing causes for trial to Athens, or other
sufferings of the subjects generally,—he has nothing to say except
that they were defenceless and degraded subjects, and that Athens
held authority over them without and against their own consent: and
in the case of Mitylênê, not so much as this could be said, since
she was on the footing of an equal, armed, and autonomous ally. Of
course, this state of forced dependence was one which the allies, or
such of them as could stand alone, would naturally and reasonably
shake off whenever they had an opportunity:<a id="FNanchor_90"
href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> but the negative
evidence, derived from the speech of the Mitylenæan orator, goes far
to make out the point contended for by the Athenian speaker at Sparta
immediately before the war,—that, beyond the fact of such forced
dependence, the allies had little practically to complain of. A city
like Mitylênê, moreover,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[p.
48]</span> would be strong enough to protect itself and its own
commerce without the help of Athens: but to the weaker allies, the
breaking up of the Athenian empire would have greatly lessened the
security both of individuals and of commerce, in the waters of the
Ægean, and their freedom would thus have been purchased at the
cost of considerable positive disadvantages.<a id="FNanchor_91"
href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[p. 49]</span></p>

<p>Nearly the whole of the Grecian world, putting aside Italian,
Sicilian, and African Greeks, was at this time included either in
the alliance of Lacedæmon or in that of Athens, so that the truce
of thirty years insured a suspension of hostilities everywhere.
Moreover, the Lacedæmonian confederates had determined by majority
of votes to refuse the request of Samos for<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_50">[p. 50]</span> aid in her revolt against Athens:
whereby it seemed established, as practical international law, that
neither of these two great aggregate bodies should intermeddle
with the other, and that each should restrain or punish its own
disobedient members.<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92"
class="fnanchor">[92]</a> Of this refusal, which materially
affected the course of events, the main advisers had been the
Corinthians, in spite of that fear and dislike of Athens which
prompted many of the allies to vote for war.<a id="FNanchor_93"
href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> The position of the
Corinthians was peculiar; for while Sparta and her other allies were
chiefly land-powers, Corinth had been from early times maritime,
commercial, and colonizing,—she had been indeed once the first
naval power in Greece, along with Ægina; but either she had not
increased it at all during the last forty years, or, if she had,
her comparative naval importance had been entirely sunk by the
gigantic expansion of Athens. The Corinthians had both commerce and
colonies,—Leukas, Anaktorium, Ambrakia, Korkyra, etc., along or near
the coast of Epirus: they had also their colony Potidæa, situated
on the isthmus of Pallênê, in Thrace, and intimately connected
with them: and the interest of their commerce made them extremely
averse to any collision with the superior navy of the Athenians.
It was this consideration which had induced them to resist the
impulse of the Lacedæmonian allies towards war on behalf of Samos:
for though their feelings, both of jealousy and hatred against
Athens were even now strong,<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94"
class="fnanchor">[94]</a> arising greatly out of the struggle a
few years before for the acquisition of Megara to the Athenian
alliance,—prudence indicated that, in a war against the first
naval power in Greece, they were sure to be the greatest losers.
So long as the policy of Corinth pointed towards peace, there was
every probability that war would be avoided, or at least accepted
only in a case of grave necessity, by the Lacedæmonian alliance.
But a contingency, distant as well as unexpected, which occurred
about five years<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[p. 51]</span>
after the revolt of Samos, reversed all these chances, and not only
extinguished the dispositions of Corinth towards peace, but even
transformed her into the forward instigator of war.</p>

<p>Amidst the various colonies planted from Corinth along the
coast of Epirus, the greater number acknowledged on her part an
hegemony, or supremacy.<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95"
class="fnanchor">[95]</a> What extent of real power and interference
this acknowledgment implied, in addition to the honorary dignity,
we are not in a condition to say; but the Corinthians were popular,
and had not carried their interference beyond the point which the
colonists themselves found acceptable. To these amicable relations,
however, the powerful Korkyra formed a glaring exception, having been
generally at variance, sometimes in the most aggravated hostility,
with its mother-city, and withholding from her even the accustomed
tributes of honorary and filial respect. It was amidst such relations
of habitual ill-will between Corinth and Korkyra, that a dispute
grew up respecting the city of Epidamnus, known afterwards, in the
Roman times, as Dyrrachium, hard by the modern Durazzo,—a colony
founded by the Korkyræans on the coast of Illyria, in the Ionic gulf,
considerably to the north of their own island. So strong was the
sanctity of Grecian custom in respect to the foundation of colonies,
that the Korkyræans, in spite of their enmity to Corinth, had been
obliged to select the œkist, or founder-in-chief of Epidamnus, from
that city,—a citizen of Herakleid descent, named Phalius,—along
with whom there had also come some Corinthian settlers: so that
Epidamnus, though a Korkyræan colony, was nevertheless a recognized
granddaughter, if the expression may be allowed, of Corinth,
the recollection of which was perpetuated by the solemnities
periodically celebrated in honor of the œkist.<a id="FNanchor_96"
href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p>Founded on the isthmus of an outlaying peninsula on the sea-coast
of the Illyrian Taulantii, Epidamnus was at first very prosperous,
and acquired a considerable territory as well as a numerous
population. But during the years immediately preceding the period
which we have now reached, it had been exposed to great reverses:
internal sedition between the oligarchy<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_52">[p. 52]</span> and the people, aggravated by attacks
from the neighboring Illyrians, had crippled its power: and a recent
revolution, in which the people put down the oligarchy, had reduced
it still farther,—since the oligarchical exiles, collecting a
force and allying themselves with the Illyrians, harassed the city
grievously both by sea and land. The Epidamnian democracy was in such
straits as to be forced to send to Korkyra for aid: their envoys sat
down as suppliants at the temple of Hêrê, cast themselves on the
mercy of the Korkyræans, and besought them to act both as mediators
with the exiled oligarchy and as auxiliaries against the Illyrians.
Though the Korkyræans themselves, democratically governed, might have
been expected to sympathize with these suppliants and their prayers,
yet their feeling was decidedly opposite: for it was the Epidamnian
oligarchy who were principally connected with Korkyra, from whence
their forefathers had emigrated, and where their family burial-places
as well as their kinsmen were still to be found:<a id="FNanchor_97"
href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> while the demos, or
small proprietors and tradesmen of Epidamnus, may perhaps have been
of miscellaneous origin, and at any rate had no visible memorials of
ancient lineage in the mother-island. Having been refused aid from
Korkyra, and finding their distressed condition insupportable, the
Epidamnians next thought of applying to Corinth: but as this was a
step of questionable propriety, their envoys were directed first to
take the opinion of the Delphian god. His oracle having given an
unqualified sanction, they proceeded to Corinth with their mission;
describing their distress as well as their unavailing application at
Korkyra,—tendering Epidamnus to the Corinthians as to its œkists and
chiefs, with the most urgent entreaties for immediate aid to preserve
it from ruin,—and not omitting to insist on the divine sanction
just obtained. It was found easy to persuade the Corinthians, who,
looking upon Epidamnus as a joint colony from Corinth and Korkyra,
thought themselves not only authorized, but bound, to undertake its
defence, a resolution much prompted by their ancient feud against
Korkyra. They speedily organized an expedition, consisting partly of
intended new settlers, partly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[p.
53]</span> of a protecting military force,—Corinthian, Leukadian, and
Ambrakiôtic: which combined body, in order to avoid opposition from
the powerful Korkyræan navy, was marched by land as far as Apollônia,
and transported from thence by sea to Epidamnus.<a id="FNanchor_98"
href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>The arrival of such a reinforcement rescued the city for the
moment, but drew upon it a formidable increase of peril from the
Korkyræans, who looked upon the interference of Corinth as an
infringement of their rights, and resented it in the strongest
manner. Their feelings were farther inflamed by the Epidamnian
oligarchical exiles, who, coming to the island with petition for
succor, and appeals to the tombs of their Korkyræan ancestors, found
a ready sympathy. They were placed on board a fleet of twenty-five
triremes, afterwards strengthened by a farther reinforcement,
which was sent to Epidamnus with the insulting requisition that
they should be forthwith restored, and the new-comers from Corinth
dismissed. No attention being paid to these demands, the Korkyræans
commenced the blockade of the city with forty ships, and with an
auxiliary land-force of Illyrians,—making proclamation that any
person within, citizen or not, might depart safely if he chose, but
would be dealt with as an enemy if he remained. How many persons
profited by this permission we do not know: but at least enough
to convey to Corinth the news that their troops in Epidamnus were
closely besieged. The Corinthians immediately hastened the equipment
of a second expedition,—sufficient not only for the rescue of the
place, but to surmount that resistance which the Korkyræans were
sure to offer. In addition to thirty triremes, and three thousand
hoplites, of their own, they solicited aid both in ships and money
from many of their allies: eight ships fully manned were furnished
by Megara, four by Palês, in the island of Kephallênia, five by
Epidaurus, two by Trœzen, one by Hermionê, ten by Leukas, and eight
by Ambrakia,—together with pecuniary contributions from Thebes,
Phlius, and Elis. They farther proclaimed a public invitation for new
settlers to Epidamnus, promising equal political rights to all; an
option being allowed to anyone who wished to become a settler without
being ready<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[p. 54]</span> to
depart at once, to insure future admission by depositing the sum of
fifty Corinthian drachmas. Though it might seem that the prospects
of these new settlers were full of doubt and danger, such was the
confidence entertained in the metropolitan protection of Corinth,
that many were found as well to join the fleet, as to pay down the
deposit for the liberty of future junction.</p>

<p>All these proceedings on the part of Corinth, though undertaken
with intentional hostility towards Korkyra, had not been preceded by
any formal proposition, such as was customary among Grecian states,—a
harshness of dealing arising not merely from her hatred towards
Korkyra, but also from the peculiar political position of that
island, which stood alone and isolated, not enrolled either in the
Athenian or in the Lacedæmonian alliance. The Korkyræans, well aware
of the serious preparation now going on at Corinth, and of the union
among so many cities against them, felt themselves hardly a match for
it alone, in spite of their wealth and their formidable naval force
of one hundred and twenty triremes, inferior only to that of Athens.
They made an effort to avert the storm by peaceable means, prevailing
upon some mediators from Sparta and Sikyon to accompany them to
Corinth; where, while they required that the forces and settlers
recently despatched to Epidamnus should be withdrawn, denying all
right on the part of Corinth to interfere in that colony,—they at
the same time offered, if the point were disputed, to refer it for
arbitration either to some impartial Peloponnesian city, or to the
Delphian oracle; such arbiter to determine to which of the two
cities Epidamnus as a colony really belonged, and the decision to be
obeyed by both. They solemnly deprecated recourse to arms, which,
if persisted in, would drive them as a matter of necessity to seek
new allies such as they would not willingly apply to. To this the
Corinthians answered, that they could entertain no proposition until
the Korkyræan besieging force was withdrawn from Epidamnus: whereupon
the Korkyræans rejoined that they would withdraw it at once, provided
the new settlers and the troops sent by Corinth were removed at the
same time. Either there ought to be this reciprocal retirement,
or the Korkyræans would acquiesce in<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_55">[p. 55]</span> this <i>statu quo</i> on both sides, until the
arbiters should have decided.<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99"
class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p>Although the Korkyræans had been unwarrantably harsh in rejecting
the first supplication from Epidamnus, yet in their propositions made
at Corinth, right and equity were on their side. But the Corinthians
had gone too far, and assumed an attitude too decidedly aggressive,
to admit of listening to arbitration, and accordingly, so soon as
their armament was equipped, they set sail for Epidamnus, despatching
a herald to declare war formally against the Korkyræans. As soon
as the armament, consisting of seventy triremes, under Aristeus,
Kallikratês, and Timanor, with two thousand five hundred hoplites,
under Archetimus and Isarchidas, had reached Cape Aktium, at the
mouth of the Ambrakian gulf, it was met by a Korkyræan herald in
a little boat forbidding all farther advance,—a summons of course
unavailing, and quickly followed by the appearance of the Korkyræan
fleet. Out of the one hundred and twenty triremes which constituted
the naval establishment of the island, forty were engaged in the
siege of Epidamnus, but all the remaining eighty were now brought
into service; the older ships being specially repaired for the
occasion. In the action which ensued, they gained a complete victory,
destroying fifteen Corinthian ships, and taking a considerable
number of prisoners. And on the very day of the victory, Epidamnus
surrendered to their besieging fleet, under covenant that the
Corinthians within it should be held as prisoners, and that the other
new-comers should be sold as slaves. The Corinthians and their allies
did not long keep the sea after their defeat, but retired home, while
the Korkyræans remained undisputed masters of the neighboring sea.
Having erected a trophy on Leukimmê, the adjoining promontory of
their island, they proceeded, according to the melancholy practice of
Grecian warfare, to kill all their prisoners,—except the Corinthians,
who were carried home and detained as prizes of great value for
purposes of negotiation. They next began to take vengeance on those
allies of Corinth, who had lent assistance to the recent expedition:
they ravaged the territory of Leukas, burned Kyllênê, the seaport of
Elis,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[p. 56]</span> and inflicted
so much damage that the Corinthians were compelled towards the end
of the summer to send a second armament to Cape Aktium, for the
defence of Leukas, Anaktorium, and Ambrakia. The Korkyræan fleet
was again assembled near Cape Leukimmê, but no farther action took
place, and at the approach of winter both armaments were disbanded.<a
id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p>Deeply were the Corinthians humiliated by their defeat at sea,
together with the dispersion of the settlers whom they had brought
together; and though their original project was frustrated by the
loss of Epidamnus, they were only the more bent on complete revenge
against their old enemy Korkyra. They employed themselves, for two
entire years after the battle, in building new ships and providing
an armament adequate to their purposes: and in particular, they sent
round not only to the Peloponnesian seaports, but also to the islands
under the empire of Athens, in order to take into their pay the
best class of seamen. By such prolonged efforts, ninety well-manned
Corinthian ships were ready to set sail in the third year after the
battle: and the entire fleet, when reinforced by the allies, amounted
to not less than one hundred and fifty sail: twenty-seven triremes
from Ambrakia, twelve from Megara, ten from Elis, as many from
Leukas, and one from Anaktorium. Each of these allied squadrons had
officers of its own, while the Corinthian Xenokleidês and four others
were commanders-in-chief.<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101"
class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p>But the elaborate preparations going on at Corinth were no secret
to the Korkyræans, who well knew, besides, the numerous allies which
that city could command, and her extensive influence throughout
Greece. So formidable an attack was more than they could venture to
brave, alone and unaided. They had never yet enrolled themselves
among the allies either of Athens or of Lacedæmon: it had always
been their pride and policy to maintain a separate line of action,
which, by means of their wealth, their power, and their very peculiar
position, they had hitherto been enabled to do with safety. That they
had been able so to proceed with safety, however, was considered
both by friends and enemies as a peculiarity belonging to their
island; from whence we may draw an inference how little the islands
in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[p. 57]</span> Ægean, now
under the Athenian empire, would have been able to maintain any real
independence, if that empire had been broken up. But though Korkyra
had been secure in this policy of isolation up to the present moment,
such had been the increase and consolidation of forces elsewhere
throughout Greece, that even she could pursue it no longer. To
apply for admission into the Lacedæmonian confederacy, wherein her
immediate enemy exercised paramount influence, being out of the
question, she had no choice except to seek alliance with Athens.
That city had as yet no dependencies in the Ionic gulf; she was not
of kindred lineage, nor had she had any previous amicable relations
with the Dorian Korkyra. But if there was thus no previous fact or
feeling to lay the foundation of alliance, neither was there anything
to forbid it: for in the truce between Athens and Sparta, it had been
expressly stipulated, that any city, not actually enrolled in the
alliance of either, might join the one or the other at pleasure.<a
id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>
While the proposition of alliance was thus formally open either for
acceptance or refusal, the time and circumstances under which it was
to be made rendered it full of grave contingencies to all parties;
and the Korkyræan envoys, who now for the first time visited Athens,
for the purpose of making it, came thither with doubtful hopes of
success, though to their island the question was one of life or
death.</p>

<p>According to the modern theories of government, to declare
war, to make peace, and to contract alliances, are functions
proper to be intrusted to the executive government apart from the
representative assembly. According to ancient ideas, these were
precisely the topics most essential to submit for the decision of
the full assembly of the people: and in point of fact they were
so submitted, even under governments only partially democratical;
much more, of course, under the complete democracy of Athens. The
Korkyræan envoys, on reaching that city, would first open their
business to the stratêgi, or generals of the state, who would appoint
a day for them to be heard before the public assembly, with full
notice beforehand to the citizens. The mission was no secret, for
the Korkyræans had themselves intimated their intention at Corinth,
at the time when they proposed reference<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_58">[p. 58]</span> of the quarrel to arbitration: and
even without such notice, the political necessity of the step was
obvious enough to make the Corinthians anticipate it. Lastly, their
<i>proxeni</i> at Athens, Athenian citizens who watched over Corinthian
interests, public and private, in confidential correspondence with
that government,—and who, sometimes by appointment, sometimes as
volunteers, discharged partly the functions of ambassadors in modern
times, would communicate to them the arrival of the Korkyræan envoys.
So that, on the day appointed for the latter to be heard before the
public assembly, Corinthian envoys were also present to answer them
and to oppose the granting of their prayer.</p>

<p>Thucydidês has given in his history the speeches of both; that is,
speeches of his own composition, but representing in all probability
the substance of what was actually said, and of what he perhaps
himself heard. Though pervaded throughout by the peculiar style and
harsh structure of the historian, these speeches are yet among the
plainest and most business-like in his whole work, bringing before
us thoroughly the existing situation; which was one of doubt and
difficulty, presenting reasons of considerable force on each of
the opposite sides. The Korkyræans, after lamenting their previous
improvidence, which had induced them to defer seeking alliance until
the hour of need arrived, presented themselves as claimants for the
friendship of Athens, on the strongest grounds of common interest
and reciprocal usefulness. Though their existing danger and want
of Athenian support was now urgent, it had not been brought upon
them in an unjust quarrel, or by disgraceful conduct: they had
proposed to Corinth a fair arbitration respecting Epidamnus, and
their application had been refused,—which showed where the right of
the case lay; moreover, they were now exposed single-handed, not to
Corinth alone, whom they had already vanquished, but to a formidable
confederacy, organized under her auspices, including choice mariners
hired even from the allies of Athens. In granting their prayer,
Athens would, in the first place, neutralize this misemployment of
her own mariners, and would, at the same time, confer an indelible
obligation, protect the cause of right, and secure to herself a most
important reinforcement. For, next to her own, the Korkyræan naval
force was the most powerful in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[p.
59]</span> Greece, and this was now placed within her reach: if, by
declining the present offer, she permitted Korkyra to be overcome,
that naval force would pass to the side of her enemies: for such were
Corinth and the Peloponnesian alliance,—and such they would soon be
openly declared. In the existing state of Greece, a collision between
that alliance and Athens could not long be postponed: and it was with
a view to this contingency that the Corinthians were now seeking
to seize Korkyra along with her naval force.<a id="FNanchor_103"
href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> The policy of Athens,
therefore, imperiously called upon her to frustrate such a design,
by now assisting the Korkyræans. She was permitted to do this by the
terms of the thirty years’ truce: and although some might contend
that, in the present critical conjuncture, acceptance of Korkyra
was tantamount to a declaration of war with Corinth, yet the fact
would falsify such predictions; for Athens would so strengthen
herself that her enemies would be more than ever unwilling to
attack her. She would not only render her naval force irresistibly
powerful, but would become mistress of the communication between
Sicily and Peloponnesus, and thus prevent the Sicilian Dorians from
sending reinforcements to the Peloponnesians.<a id="FNanchor_104"
href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>To these representations on the part of the Korkyræans, the
Corinthian speakers made reply. They denounced the selfish and
iniquitous policy pursued by Korkyra, not less in the matter
of Epidamnus, than in all former time,<a id="FNanchor_105"
href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>—which was the
real reason why she had ever been ashamed of honest allies.
Above all things, she had always acted undutifully and wickedly
towards Corinth, her mother-city, to whom she was bound by those
ties of colonial allegiance which Grecian morality recognized,
and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[p. 60]</span> which the
other Corinthian colonies cheerfully obeyed.<a id="FNanchor_106"
href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> Epidamnus was not
a Korkyræan, but a Corinthian colony, and the Korkyræans, having
committed wrong in besieging it, had proposed arbitration without
being willing to withdraw their troops while arbitration was pending:
they now impudently came to ask Athens to become accessory after the
fact in such injustice. The provision of the thirty years’ truce
might seem indeed to allow Athens to receive them as allies: but
that provision was not intended to permit the reception of cities
already under the tie of colonial allegiance elsewhere,—still less
the reception of cities engaged in an active and pending quarrel,
where any countenance to one party in the quarrel was necessarily a
declaration of war against the opposite. If either party had a right
to invoke the aid of Athens on this occasion, Corinth had a better
right than Korkyra: for the latter had never had any transactions
with the Athenians, while Corinth was not only still under covenant
of amity with them, through the thirty years’ truce,—but had also
rendered material service to them by dissuading the Peloponnesian
allies from assisting the revolted Samos. By such dissuasion, the
Corinthians had upheld the principle of Grecian international
law, that each alliance was entitled to punish its own refractory
members: they now called upon Athens to respect this principle,
by not interfering between Corinth and her colonial allies,<a
id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>
especially as the violation of it would recoil inconveniently
upon Athens herself, with her numerous dependencies. As for the
fear of an impending war<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[p.
61]</span> between the Peloponnesian alliance and Athens, such a
contingency was as yet uncertain,—and might possibly never occur at
all, if Athens dealt justly, and consented to conciliate Corinth
on this critical occasion: but it would assuredly occur if she
refused such conciliation, and the dangers thus entailed upon
Athens would be far greater than the promised naval coöperation of
Korkyra would compensate.<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108"
class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p>Such was the substance of the arguments urged by the contending
envoys before the Athenian public assembly, in this momentous debate.
For two days did the debate continue, the assembly being adjourned
over to the morrow: so considerable was the number of speakers, and
probably also the divergence of their views. Unluckily, Thucydidês
does not give us any of these Athenian discourses,—not even that
of Periklês, who determined the ultimate result. Epidamnus, with
its disputed question of metropolitan right, occupied little of the
attention of the Athenian assembly: but the Korkyræan naval force
was indeed an immense item, since the question was, whether it
should stand on their side or against them,—an item which nothing
could counterbalance except the dangers of a Peloponnesian war. “Let
us avoid this last calamity (was the opinion of many) even at the
sacrifice of seeing Korkyra conquered, and all her ships and seamen
in the service of the Peloponnesian league.” “You will not really
avoid it, even by that great sacrifice (was the reply of others): the
generating causes of war are at work,—and it will infallibly come,
whatever you may determine respecting Korkyra: avail yourselves of
the present opening, instead of being driven ultimately to undertake
the war at great comparative disadvantage.” Of these two views,
the former was at first decidedly preponderant in the assembly;<a
id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>
but they gradually came round to the latter, which was conformable
to the steady conviction of Periklês. It was, however, resolved to
take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[p. 62]</span> a sort of
middle course, so as to save Korkyra, and yet, if possible, to escape
violation of the existing truce and the consequent Peloponnesian
war. To comply with the request of the Korkyræans, by adopting
them unreservedly as allies, would have laid the Athenians under
the necessity of accompanying them in an attack of Corinth, if
required,—which would have been a manifest infringement of the
truce. Accordingly, nothing more was concluded than an alliance
for purposes strictly defensive, to preserve Korkyra and her
possessions in case they were attacked: nor was any greater force
equipped to back this resolve than a squadron of ten triremes,
under Lacedæmonius, son of Kimon. The smallness of this force
would satisfy the Corinthians that no aggression was contemplated
against their city, while it would save Korkyra from ruin, and
would in fact feed the war so as to weaken and cripple the naval
force of both parties,<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110"
class="fnanchor">[110]</a>—which was the best result that Athens
could hope for. The instructions to Lacedæmonius and his two
colleagues were express; not to engage in fight with the Corinthians
unless they were actually approaching Korkyra, or some Korkyræan
possession, with a view to attack: but in that case to do his best on
the defensive.</p>

<p>The great Corinthian armament of one hundred and fifty sail
soon took its departure from the gulf, and reached a harbor on the
coast of Epirus, at the cape called Cheimerium, nearly opposite to
the southern extremity of Korkyra: they there established a naval
station and camp, summoning to their aid a considerable force from
the friendly Epirotic tribes in the neighborhood. The Korkyræan
fleet of one hundred and ten sail, under Meikiadês and two others,
together with the ten Athenian ships, took station at one of the
adjoining islands called Sybota, while the land force and one
thousand Zakynthian hoplites were posted on the Korkyræan Cape
Leukimmê. Both sides prepared for battle: the Corinthians, taking on
board three days’ provisions, sailed by night from Cheimerium, and
encountered in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[p. 63]</span> the
morning the Korkyræan fleet advancing towards them, distributed into
three squadrons, one under each of the three generals, and having
the ten Athenian ships at the extreme right. Opposed to them were
ranged the choice vessels of the Corinthians, occupying the left of
their aggregate fleet: next came the various allies, with Megarians
and Ambrakiots on the extreme right. Never before had two such
numerous fleets, both Grecian, engaged in battle; but the tactics
and manœuvring were not commensurate to the numbers. The decks were
crowded with hoplites and bowmen, while the rowers below, on the
Korkyræan side at least, were in great part slaves: the ships, on
both sides, being rowed forward so as to drive in direct impact, prow
against prow, were grappled together, and a fierce hand-combat was
then commenced between the troops on board of each, as if they were
on land,—or rather, like boarding-parties: all upon the old-fashioned
system of Grecian sea-fight, without any of those improvements
which had been introduced into the Athenian navy during the last
generation. In Athenian naval attack, the ship, the rowers, and the
steersman, were of much greater importance than the armed troops on
deck: by strength and exactness of rowing, by rapid and sudden change
of direction, by feints calculated to deceive, the Athenian captain
sought to drive the sharp beak of his vessel, not against the prow,
but against the weaker and more vulnerable parts of his enemy,—side,
oars, or stern. The ship thus became in the hands of her crew the
real weapon of attack, which was first to disable the enemy and leave
him unmanageable on the water; and not until this was done did the
armed troops on deck begin their operations.<a id="FNanchor_111"
href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> Lacedæmonius, with
his ten armed ships, though forbidden by his instructions to share
in the battle, lent as much aid as he could by taking station at
the extremity of the line, and by making motions as if about<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[p. 64]</span> to attack; while his
seamen had full leisure to contemplate what they would despise as the
lubberly handling of the ships on both sides. All was confusion after
the battle had been joined; the ships on both sides became entangled,
the oars broken and unmanageable, orders could neither be heard nor
obeyed, and the individual valor of the hoplites and bowmen on deck
was the decisive point on which victory turned.</p>

<p>On the right wing of the Corinthians, the left of the Korkyræans
was victorious; their twenty ships drove back the Ambrakiot allies
of Corinth, and not only pursued them to the shore, but also landed
and plundered the tents. Their rashness in thus keeping so long out
of the battle proved incalculably mischievous, the rather as their
total number was inferior: for their right wing, opposed to the best
ships of Corinth, was after a hard struggle thoroughly beaten. Many
of the ships were disabled, and the rest obliged to retreat as they
could,—a retreat which the victorious ships on the other wing might
have protected, had there been any effective discipline in the fleet,
but which now was only imperfectly aided by the ten Athenian ships
under Lacedæmonius. These Athenians, though at first they obeyed the
instructions from home, in abstaining from actual blows, yet,—when
the battle became doubtful, and still more, when the Corinthians were
pressing their victory,—could no longer keep aloof, but attacked
the pursuers in good earnest, and did much to save the defeated
Korkyræans. As soon as the latter had been pursued as far as their
own island, the victorious Corinthians returned to the scene of
action, which was covered with disabled and water-logged ships, their
own and their enemies, as well as with seamen, soldiers, and wounded
men, either helpless aboard the wrecks, or keeping above water as
well as they could,—among them many of their own citizens and allies,
especially on their defeated right wing. Through these disabled
vessels they sailed, not attempting to tow them off, but looking
only to the crews aboard, and making some of them prisoners, but
putting the greater number to death: some even of their own allies
were thus slain, not being easily distinguishable. They then picked
up their own dead bodies as well as they could, and transported
them to Sybota, the nearest point of the coast of Epirus; after
which they again mustered their fleet, and returned to resume<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[p. 65]</span> the attack against the
Korkyræans on their own coast. The latter got together as many of
their ships as were seaworthy, together with the small reserve which
had remained in harbor, in order to prevent at any rate a landing on
the coast: and the Athenian ships, now within the strict letter of
their instructions, prepared to coöperate with full energy in the
defence. It was already late in the afternoon: but the Corinthian
fleet, though their pæan had already been shouted for attack, were
suddenly seen to back water instead of advancing; presently they
headed round, and sailed directly away to the Epirotic coast. Nor did
the Korkyræans comprehend the cause of this sudden retreat, until
at length it was proclaimed that an unexpected relief of twenty
fresh Athenian ships was approaching, under Glaukon and Andokidês,
which the Corinthians had been the first to descry, and had even
believed to be the forerunners of a larger fleet. It was already
dark when these fresh ships reached Cape Leukimmê, having traversed
the waters covered with wrecks and dead bodies;<a id="FNanchor_112"
href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> and at first the
Korkyræans even mistook them for enemies. The reinforcement had been
sent from Athens, probably after more accurate information of the
comparative force of Corinth and Korkyra, under the impression that
the original ten ships would prove inadequate for the purpose of
defence,—an impression more than verified by the reality.</p>

<p>Though the twenty Athenian ships were not, as the Corinthians
had imagined, the precursors of a larger fleet, they were found
sufficient to change completely the face of affairs. In the
preceding action, the Korkyræans had had seventy ships sunk or
disabled,—the Corinthians only thirty,—so that the superiority of
numbers was still on the side of the latter, who were, however,
encumbered with the care of one thousand prisoners, eight hundred
of them slaves, captured, not easy either to lodge or to guard in
the narrow accommodations of an ancient trireme. Even apart from
this embarrassment, the Corinthians were in no temper to hazard a
second battle against thirty Athenian ships, in addition to the
remaining Korkyræan: and when their enemies<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_66">[p. 66]</span> sailed across to offer them battle on
the Epirotic coast, they not only refused it, but thought of nothing
but immediate retreat,—with serious alarm lest the Athenians should
now act aggressively, treating all amicable relations between Athens
and Corinth as practically extinguished by the events of the day
before. Having ranged their fleet in line, not far from shore,
they tested the dispositions of the Athenian commanders by sending
forward a little boat with a few men to address to them the following
remonstrance,—the men carried no herald’s staff (<i>we</i> should say,
no flag of truce), and were therefore completely without protection
against an enemy. “Ye act wrongfully, Athenians (they exclaimed), in
beginning the war and violating the truce; for ye are using arms to
oppose us in punishing our enemies. If it be really your intention
to hinder us from sailing against Korkyra, or anywhere else that
we choose, in breach of the truce, take first of all us who now
address you, and deal with us as enemies.” It was not the fault of
the Korkyræans that this last idea was not instantly realized: for
such of them as were near enough to hear, instigated the Athenians
by violent shouts to kill the men in the boat. But the latter, far
from listening to such an appeal, dismissed them with the answer: “We
neither begin the war nor break the truce, Peloponnesians; we have
come simply to aid these Korkyræans, our allies. If ye wish to sail
anywhere else, we make no opposition: but if ye are about to sail
against Korkyra, or any of her possessions, we shall use our best
means to prevent you.” Both the answer, and the treatment of the men
in the boat, satisfied the Corinthians that their retreat would be
unopposed, and they accordingly commenced it as soon as they could
get ready, staying, however, to erect a trophy at Sybota, on the
Epirotic coast, in commemoration of their advantage on the preceding
day. In their voyage homeward, they surprised Anaktorium, at the
mouth of the Ambrakiôtic gulf, which they had hitherto possessed
jointly with the Korkyræans; planting in it a reinforcement of
Corinthian settlers as guarantee for future fidelity. On reaching
Corinth, the armament was disbanded, and the great majority of the
prisoners taken—eight hundred slaves—were sold; but the remainder,
two hundred and fifty in number, were detained and treated with
peculiar kindness. Many of them were of the first and richest
families of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[p. 67]</span> the
island, and the Corinthians designed to gain them over, so as to
make them instruments for effecting a revolution in the island. The
calamitous incidents arising from their return will appear in a
future chapter.</p>

<p>Thus relieved from all danger, the Korkyræans picked up the dead
bodies and the wrecks which had floated during the night on to their
island, and even found sufficient pretence to erect a trophy, chiefly
in consequence of their partial success on the left wing. In truth,
they had been only rescued from ruin by the unexpected coming of
the last Athenian ships: but the last result was as triumphant to
them as it was disastrous and humiliating to the Corinthians, who
had incurred an immense cost, and taxed all their willing allies,
only to leave their enemy stronger than she was before. From this
time forward they considered the thirty years’ truce as broken, and
conceived a hatred, alike deadly and undisguised, against Athens; so
that the latter gained nothing by the moderation of her admirals in
sparing the Corinthian fleet off the coast of Epirus. An opportunity
was not long wanting for the Corinthians to strike a blow at their
enemy, through one of her wide-spread dependencies.</p>

<p>On the isthmus of that lesser peninsula called Pellênê, which
forms the westernmost of the three prongs of the greater peninsula
called Chalkidikê, between the Thermaic and the Strymonic gulfs,
was situated the Dorian town of Potidæa, one of the tributary
allies of Athens, but originally colonized from Corinth, and still
maintaining a certain metropolitan allegiance towards the latter:
insomuch that every year certain Corinthians were sent thither as
magistrates, under the title of Epidemiurgi. On various points of the
neighboring coast, also, there were several small towns belonging
to the Chalkidians and Bottiæans, enrolled in like manner in the
list of Athenian tributaries. The neighboring inland territory,
Mygdonia and Chalkidikê,<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113"
class="fnanchor">[113]</a> was held by the Macedonian king
Perdikkas, son of that Alexander who had<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_68">[p. 68]</span> taken part, fifty years before, in the
expedition of Xerxes. These two princes appear gradually to have
extended their dominions, after the ruin of Persian power in Thrace
by the exertions of Athens, until at length they acquired all the
territory between the rivers Axius and Strymon. Now Perdikkas had
been for some time the friend and ally of Athens; but there were
other Macedonian princes, his brother Philip and Derdas, holding
independent principalities in the upper country,<a id="FNanchor_114"
href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> apparently on the
higher course of the Axius near the Pæonian tribes, with whom he
was in a state of dispute. These princes having been accepted as
the allies of Athens, Perdikkas from that time became her active
enemy, and it was from his intrigues that all the difficulties of
Athens on that coast took their first origin. The Athenian empire
was much less complete and secure over the seaports on the mainland
than over the islands:<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115"
class="fnanchor">[115]</a> for the former were always more or
less dependent on any powerful land-neighbor, sometimes more
dependent on him than upon the mistress of the sea; and we shall
find Athens herself cultivating assiduously the favor of Sitalkês
and other strong Thracian potentates, as an aid to her dominion
over the seaports.<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116"
class="fnanchor">[116]</a> Perdikkas immediately began to incite
and aid the Chalkidians and Bottiæans to revolt from Athens, and
the violent enmity against the latter, kindled in the bosoms of
the Corinthians by the recent events at Korkyra, enabled him to
extend the same projects to Potidæa. Not only did he send envoys to
Corinth in order to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[p. 69]</span>
concert measures for provoking the revolt of Potidæa, but also to
Sparta, instigating the Peloponnesian league to a general declaration
of war against Athens.<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117"
class="fnanchor">[117]</a> And he farther prevailed on many of
the Chalkidian inhabitants to abandon their separate small towns
on the sea-coast, for the purpose of joint residence at Olynthus,
which was several stadia from the sea. Thus that town, as well as
the Chalkidian interest, became much strengthened, while Perdikkas
farther assigned some territory near Lake Bolbê to contribute to the
temporary maintenance of the concentrated population.</p>

<p>The Athenians were not ignorant both of his hostile preparations
and of the dangers which awaited them from Corinth after the
Korkyræan sea-fight; immediately after which they sent to take
precautions against the revolt of Potidæa; requiring the inhabitants
to take down their wall on the side of Pellênê, so as to leave the
town open on the side of the peninsula, or on what may be called
the sea-side, and fortified only towards the mainland,—requiring
them farther both to deliver hostages and to dismiss the annual
magistrates who came to them from Corinth. An Athenian armament of
thirty triremes and one thousand hoplites, under Archestratus and
ten others, despatched to act against Perdikkas in the Thermaic
gulf, was directed at the same time to enforce these requisitions
against Potidæa, and to repress any dispositions to revolt among the
neighboring Chalkidians. Immediately on receiving these requisitions,
the Potidæans sent envoys both to Athens, for the purpose of evading
and gaining time,—and to Sparta, in conjunction with Corinth, in
order to determine a Lacedæmonian invasion of Attica, in the event
of Potidæa being attacked by Athens. From the Spartan authorities
they obtained a distinct affirmative promise, in spite of the thirty
years’ truce still subsisting: at Athens they had no success, and
they accordingly openly revolted (seemingly about midsummer, 432
<small>B.C.</small>), at the same time that the armament
under Archestratus sailed. The Chalkidians and Bottiæans revolted at
the same time, at the express instigation of Corinth, accompanied
by solemn oaths and promises of assistance.<a id="FNanchor_118"
href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> Archestratus with his
fleet, on reaching the Thermaic gulf, found them all in pro<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[p. 70]</span>claimed enmity, but was
obliged to confine himself to the attack of Perdikkas in Macedonia,
not having numbers enough to admit of a division of his force. He
accordingly laid siege to Therma, in coöperation with the Macedonian
troops from the upper country, under Philip and the brothers of
Derdas; after taking that place, he next proceeded to besiege Pydna.
But it would probably have been wiser had he turned his whole force
instantly to the blockade of Potidæa; for during the period of more
than six weeks that he spent in the operations against Therma, the
Corinthians conveyed to Potidæa a reinforcement of sixteen hundred
hoplites and four hundred light-armed, partly their own citizens,
partly Peloponnesians, hired for the occasion,—under Aristeus, son
of Adeimantus, a man of such eminent popularity, both at Corinth and
at Potidæa, that most of the soldiers volunteered on his personal
account. Potidæa was thus put into a state of complete defence
shortly after the news of its revolt reached Athens, and long
before any second armament could be sent to attack it. A second
armament, however, was speedily sent forth.—forty triremes and two
thousand Athenian hoplites, under Kallias, son of Kalliades,<a
id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>
with four other commanders,—who, on reaching the Thermaic gulf,
joined the former body at the siege of Pydna. After prosecuting
the siege in vain for a short time, they found themselves obliged
to patch up an accommodation on the best terms they could with
Perdikkas, from the necessity of commencing immediate operations
against Aristeus and Potidæa. They then quitted Macedonia, first
crossing by sea from Pydna to the eastern coast of the Thermaic
gulf,—next attacking, though without effect, the town of Berœa,—and
then marching by land along the eastern coast of the gulf, in
the direction of Potidæa. On the third day of easy march, they
reached the seaport called Gigônus, near which they encamped.<a
id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[p. 71]</span></p>

<p>In spite of the convention concluded at Pydna, Perdikkas, whose
character for faithlessness we shall have more than one<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[p. 72]</span> occasion to notice,
was now again on the side of the Chalkidians, and sent two hundred
horse to join them, under the command of<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_73">[p. 73]</span> Iolaus. Aristeus posted his Corinthians
and Potidæans on the isthmus near Potidæa, providing a market without
the walls, in order that they might not stray in quest of provisions:
his position was on the side towards Olynthus,—which was about
seven miles off, but within sight, and in a lofty and conspicuous
situation. He here awaited the approach of the Athenians, calculating
that the Chalkidians from Olynthus would, upon the hoisting of
a given signal, assail them in the rear when they attacked him.
But Kallias was strong enough to place in reserve his Macedonian
cavalry and other allies as a check against Olynthus; while with
his Athenians and the main force he marched to the isthmus and
took position in front of Aristeus. In the battle which ensued,
Aristeus and the chosen band of Corinthians immediately about him
were completely successful, breaking the troops opposed to them, and
pursuing for a considerable distance: but the remaining Potidæans
and Peloponnesians were routed by the Athenians and driven within
the walls. On returning from pursuit, Aristeus found the victorious
Athenians between him and Potidæa, and was reduced to the alternative
either of cutting his way through them into the latter town, or of
making a retreating march to Olynthus. He chose the former as the
least of two hazards, and forced his way through the flank of the
Athenians,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[p. 74]</span> wading
into the sea in order to turn the extremity of the Potidæan wall,
which reached entirely across the isthmus, with a mole running out
at each end into the water: he effected this daring enterprise and
saved his detachment, though not without considerable difficulty and
some loss. Meanwhile, the auxiliaries from Olynthus, though they had
begun their march on seeing the concerted signal, had been kept in
check by the Macedonian horse, so that the Potidæans had been beaten
and the signal again withdrawn, before they could make any effective
diversion: nor did the cavalry on either side come into action. The
defeated Potidæans and Corinthians, having the town immediately
in their rear, lost only three hundred men, while the Athenians
lost one hundred and fifty, together with the general Kallias.<a
id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p>The victory was, however, quite complete, and the Athenians,
after having erected their trophy, and given up the enemy’s dead
for burial, immediately built their blockading wall across the
isthmus, on the side of the mainland, so as to cut off Potidæa from
all communication with Olynthus and the Chalkidians. To make the
blockade complete, a second wall across the isthmus was necessary,
on the other side towards Pallênê: but they had not force enough to
detach a completely separate body for this purpose, until after some
time they were joined by Phormio with sixteen hundred fresh hoplites
from Athens. That general, landing at Aphytis, in the peninsula of
Pallênê, marched slowly up to Potidæa, ravaging the territory in
order to draw out the citizens to battle: but the challenge not
being accepted, he undertook, and finished without obstruction, the
blockading wall on the side of Pallênê, so that the town was now
completely inclosed, and the harbor watched by the Athenian fleet.
The wall once finished, a portion of the force sufficed to guard
it, leaving Phormio at liberty to undertake aggressive operations
against the Chalkidic and Bottiæan townships. The capture of Potidæa
was now only a question of more or less time, and Aristeus, in order
that the provisions might last longer, proposed to the citizens to
choose a favorable wind, get on shipboard, and break out suddenly
from the harbor, taking their chance of eluding the Athenian fleet,
and leaving only five hundred defenders behind:<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_75">[p. 75]</span> though he offered himself to be among
those left behind, he could not determine the citizens to so bold
an enterprise, and he therefore sallied forth in the way proposed
with a small detachment, in order to try and procure relief from
without,—especially some aid or diversion from Peloponnesus. But he
was able to accomplish nothing beyond some partial warlike operations
among the Chalkidians,<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122"
class="fnanchor">[122]</a> and a successful ambuscade against the
citizens of Sermylus, which did nothing for the relief of the
blockaded town: it had, however, been so well-provisioned that it
held out for two whole years,—a period full of important events
elsewhere.</p>

<p>From these two contests between Athens and Corinth, first
indirectly at Korkyra, next distinctly and avowedly at Potidæa,
sprung those important movements in the Lacedæmonian alliance which
will be recounted in the next chapter.</p>

    FROM THE BLOCKADE OF POTIDÆA DOWN TO THE END OF THE
    FIRST YEAR OF THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR.</h2>
</div>

<p class="ti0"><span class="smcap">Even</span> before the recent
hostilities at Korkyra and Potidæa, it had been evident to reflecting
Greeks that the continued observance of the thirty years’ truce was
very uncertain, and that the mingled hatred, fear, and admiration,
which Athens inspired throughout Greece, would prompt Sparta and
the Spartan confederacy to seize the first favorable opening for
breaking down the Athenian power. That such was the disposition
of Sparta, was well understood among the Athenian allies, however
considerations of prudence and general slowness in resolving might
postpone the moment of carrying it into effect. Accordingly, not
only the Samians when they revolted had applied to the Spartan<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[p. 76]</span> confederacy for aid,
which they appear to have been prevented from obtaining chiefly
by the pacific interests then animating the Corinthians,—but also
the Lesbians had endeavored to open negotiations with Sparta for a
similar purpose, though the authorities—to whom alone the proposition
could have been communicated, since it remained secret and was
never executed—had given them no encouragement.<a id="FNanchor_123"
href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> The affairs of Athens
had been administered under the ascendency of Periklês, without any
view to extension of empire or encroachment upon others, though with
constant view to the probabilities of war, and with anxiety to keep
the city in a condition to meet it: but even the splendid internal
ornaments, which Athens at that time acquired, were probably not
without their effect in provoking jealousy on the part of other
Greeks as to her ultimate views. The only known incident, wherein
Athens had been brought into collision with a member of the Spartan
confederacy prior to the Korkyræan dispute, was the decree passed
in regard to Megara,—prohibiting the Megarians, on pain of death,
from all trade or intercourse as well with Athens as with all
ports within the Athenian empire. This prohibition was grounded on
the alleged fact, that the Megarians had harbored runaway slaves
from Athens, and had appropriated and cultivated portions of land
upon the border; partly land, the property of the goddesses of
Eleusis,—partly a strip of territory disputed between the two states,
and therefore left by mutual understanding in common pasture without
any permanent inclosure.<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124"
class="fnanchor">[124]</a> In reference to this latter point,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[p. 77]</span> the Athenian herald,
Anthemokritus had been sent to Megara to remonstrate, but had been so
rudely dealt with, that his death shortly afterwards was imputed as
a crime to the Megarians.<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125"
class="fnanchor">[125]</a> We may well suppose that ever since the
revolt of Megara, fourteen years before, which caused to Athens an
irreparable mischief, the feeling prevalent between the two towns
had been one of bitter enmity, manifesting itself in many ways,
but so much exasperated by recent events as to provoke Athens
to a signal revenge.<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126"
class="fnanchor">[126]</a> Exclusion from Athens and all the ports in
her empire, comprising nearly every island and seaport in the Ægean,
was so ruinous to the Megarians, that they loudly complained of it at
Sparta, representing it as an infraction of the thirty years<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[p. 78]</span>’ truce; though it was
undoubtedly within the legitimate right of Athens to enforce,—and
was even less harsh than the systematic expulsion of foreigners by
Sparta, with which Periklês compared it.</p>

<p>These complaints found increased attention after the war of
Korkyra and the blockade of Potidæa by the Athenians. The sentiments
of the Corinthians towards Athens had now become angry and warlike in
the highest degree: nor was it simply resentment for the past which
animated them, but also the anxiety farther to bring upon Athens so
strong a hostile pressure as should preserve Potidæa and its garrison
from capture. Accordingly, they lost no time in endeavoring to rouse
the feelings of the Spartans against Athens, and in inducing them to
invite to Sparta all such of the confederates as had any grievances
against that city. Not merely the Megarians but several other
confederates, appeared there as accusers; while the Æginetans, though
their insular position made it perilous for them to appear, made
themselves vehemently heard through the mouths of others, complaining
that Athens withheld from them that autonomy to which they were
entitled under the truce.<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127"
class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p>According to the Lacedæmonian practice, it was necessary first
that the Spartans themselves, apart from their allies, should
de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[p. 79]</span>cide whether
there existed a sufficient case of wrong done by Athens against
themselves or against Peloponnesus,—either in violation of the thirty
years’ truce, or in any other way. If the determination of Sparta
herself were in the negative, the case would never even be submitted
to the vote of the allies; but if it were in the affirmative, then
the latter would be convoked to deliver their opinion also: and
assuming that the majority of votes coincided with the previous
decision of Sparta, the entire confederacy stood then pledged
to the given line of policy,—if the majority was contrary, the
Spartans would stand alone, or with such only of the confederates
as concurred. Each allied city, great or small, had an equal right
of suffrage. It thus appears that Sparta herself did not vote as
a member of the confederacy, but separately and individually as
leader,—and that the only question ever submitted to the allies
was, whether they would or would not go along with her previous
decision. Such was the course of proceeding now followed: the
Corinthians, together with such other of the confederates as felt
either aggrieved or alarmed by Athens, presented themselves before
the public assembly of Spartan citizens, prepared to prove that the
Athenians had broken the truce, and were going on in a course of
wrong towards Peloponnesus.<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128"
class="fnanchor">[128]</a> Even in the oligarchy of Sparta, such
a question as this could only be decided by a general assembly of
Spartan citizens, qualified both by age, by regular contribution
to the public mess, and by obedience to Spartan discipline. To the
assembly so constituted the deputies of the various allied cities
addressed themselves, each setting forth his case against Athens.
The Corinthians chose to reserve themselves to the last, after the
assembly had been previously inflamed by the previous speakers.</p>

<p>Of this important assembly, on which so much of the future fate
of Greece turned, Thucydidês has preserved an account unusually
copious. First, the speech delivered by the Corinthian envoys. Next,
that of some Athenian envoys, who happening to be at the same time
in Sparta on some other matters, and being<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_80">[p. 80]</span> present in the assembly so as to
have heard the speeches both of the Corinthians and of the other
complainants, obtained permission from the magistrates to address
the assembly in their turn. Thirdly, the address of the Spartan king
Archidamus, on the course of policy proper to be adopted by Sparta.
Lastly, the brief, but eminently characteristic, address of the ephor
Stheneläidas, on putting the question for decision. These speeches,
the composition of Thucydidês himself, contain substantially the
sentiments of the parties to whom they are ascribed: neither of them
is distinctly a reply to that which has preceded, but each presents
the situation of affairs from a different point of view.</p>

<p>The Corinthians knew well that the audience whom they were about
to address had been favorably prepared for them,—for the Lacedæmonian
authorities had already given an actual promise to them and to the
Potidæans at the moment before Potidæa revolted, that they would
invade Attica. So great was the revolution in sentiment of the
Spartans, since they had declined lending aid to the much more
powerful island of Lesbos, when it proposed to revolt,—a revolution
occasioned by the altered interests and sentiments of Corinth.
Nor were the Corinthians ignorant that their positive grounds of
complaint against Athens, in respect of wrong or violation of the
existing truce, were both few and feeble. Neither in the dispute
about Potidæa nor about Korkyra, had Athens infringed the truce
or wronged the Peloponnesian alliance. In both, she had come into
collision with Corinth, singly and apart from the confederacy:
she had a right, both according to the truce and according to the
received maxims of international law, to lend defensive aid to the
Korkyræans at their own request,—she had a right also, according to
the principles laid down by the Corinthians themselves on occasion of
the revolt of Samos, to restrain the Potidæans from revolting. She
had committed nothing which could fairly be called an aggression:
indeed the aggression, both in the case of Potidæa and in that of
Korkyra, was decidedly on the side of the Corinthians: and the
Peloponnesian confederacy could only be so far implicated as it was
understood to be bound to espouse the separate quarrels, right or
wrong, of Corinth. All this was well known to the Corinthian envoys;
and accordingly we find that, in their speech<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_81">[p. 81]</span> at Sparta, they touch but lightly, and
in vague terms, on positive or recent wrongs. Even that which they
do say completely justifies the proceedings of Athens about the
affair of Korkyra, since they confess without hesitation the design
of seizing the large Korkyræan navy for the use of the Peloponnesian
alliance: while in respect of Potidæa, if we had only the speech
of the Corinthian envoy before us without any other knowledge, we
should have supposed it to be an independent state, not connected
by any permanent bonds with Athens,—we should have supposed that
the siege of Potidæa by Athens was an unprovoked aggression upon an
autonomous ally of Corinth,<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129"
class="fnanchor">[129]</a>—we should never have imagined that
Corinth had deliberately instigated and aided the revolt of the
Chalkidians as well as of the Potidæans against Athens. It might be
pretended that she had a right to do this, by virtue of her undefined
metropolitan relations with Potidæa: but at any rate, the incident
was not such as to afford any decent pretext for charge against the
Athenians, either of outrage towards Corinth,<a id="FNanchor_130"
href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> or of wrongful
aggression against the Peloponnesian confederacy.</p>

<p>To dwell much upon specific allegations of wrong, would not have
suited the purpose of the Corinthian envoy; for against such, the
thirty years’ truce expressly provided that recourse should be had
to amicable arbitration,—to which recourse he never once alludes.
He knew that, as between Corinth and Athens, war had already begun
at Potidæa; and his business, throughout nearly all of a very
emphatic speech is, to show that the Peloponnesian confederacy, and
especially Sparta, is bound to take instant part in it, not less
by prudence than by duty. He employs the most animated language to
depict the ambition, the unwearied activity, the personal effort
abroad as well as at home, the quick resolves, the sanguine hopes
never dashed by failure,—of Athens; as contrasted with the cautious,
home-keeping, indolent, scrupulous routine of Sparta. He reproaches
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[p. 82]</span> Spartans with
their backwardness and timidity, in not having repressed the growth
of Athens before she reached this formidable height,—especially in
having allowed her to fortify her city after the retreat of Xerxes,
and afterwards to build the long walls from the city to the sea.<a
id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>
The Spartans, he observes, stood alone among all Greeks, in
the notable system of keeping down an enemy not by acting, but
delaying to act,—not arresting his growth, but putting him down
when his force was doubled. Falsely, indeed, had they acquired the
reputation of being sure, when they were in reality merely slow:<a
id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>
in resisting Xerxes, as in resisting Athens, they had always been
behindhand, disappointing and leaving their friends to ruin,—while
both these enemies had only failed of complete success through their
own mistakes.</p>

<p>After half apologizing for the tartness of these reproofs,—which,
however, as the Spartans were now well-disposed to go to war
forthwith, would be well-timed and even agreeable,—the Corinthian
orator vindicates the necessity of plain-speaking by the urgent
peril of the emergency, and the formidable character of the enemy
who threatened them. “You do not reflect (he says) how thoroughly
different the Athenians are from yourselves. <i>They</i> are innovators
by nature; sharp both in devising, and in executing what they have
determined: <i>you</i> are sharp only in keeping what you have got, in
determining on nothing beyond, and in doing even less than absolute
necessity requires.<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133"
class="fnanchor">[133]</a> <i>They</i> again dare beyond their means,
run risks beyond their own judgment, and keep alive their hopes
even in desperate circumstances: <i>your</i><span class="pagenum"
id="Page_83">[p. 83]</span> peculiarity is, that your performance
comes short of your power,—you have no faith even in what your
judgment guarantees,—when in difficulties, you despair of all
escape. <i>They</i> never hang back,—<i>you</i> are habitual laggards: they
love foreign service,—you cannot stir from home: for they are always
under the belief that their movements will lead to some farther
gain, while you fancy that new projects will endanger what you have
already. When successful, they make the greatest forward march; when
defeated, they fall back the least. Moreover, they task their bodies
on behalf of their city as if they were the bodies of others,—while
their minds are most of all their own, for exertion in her service.<a
id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>
When their plans for acquisition do not come successfully out, they
feel like men robbed of what belongs to them: yet the acquisitions
when realized appear like trifles compared with what remains to be
acquired. If they sometimes fail in an attempt, new hopes arise in
some other direction to supply the want: for with them alone the
possession and the hope of what they aim at is almost simultaneous,
from their habit of quickly executing all that they have once
resolved. And in this manner do they toil throughout all their lives
amidst hardship and peril, disregarding present enjoyment in the
continual thirst for increase,—knowing no other festival recreation
except the performance of active duty,—and deeming inactive repose a
worse condition than fatiguing occupation. To speak the truth in two
words: such is their inborn temper, that they will neither remain
at rest themselves, nor allow rest to others.<a id="FNanchor_135"
href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

<p>“Such is the city which stands opposed to you, Lacedæmonians,—yet
ye still hang back from action.... Your continual scruples and apathy
would hardly be safe, even if ye had neigh<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_84">[p. 84]</span>bors like yourselves in character: but as
to dealings with Athens, your system is antiquated and out of date.
In politics as in art, it is the modern improvements which are sure
to come out victorious: and though unchanged institutions are best,
if a city be not called upon to act,—yet multiplicity of active
obligations requires multiplicity and novelty of contrivance.<a
id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>
It is through these numerous trials that the means of Athens have
acquired so much more new development than yours.”</p>

<p>The Corinthians concluded by saying, that if, after so many
previous warnings, now repeated for the last time, Sparta still
refused to protect her allies against Athens,—if she delayed to
perform her promise made to the Potidæans, of immediately invading
Attica,—they, the Corinthians, would forthwith look for safety in
some new alliance, and they felt themselves fully justified in
doing so. They admonished her to look well to the case, and to
carry forward Peloponnesus with undiminished dignity as it had
been transmitted to her from her predecessors.<a id="FNanchor_137"
href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p>Such was the memorable picture of Athens and her citizens, as
exhibited by her fiercest enemy, before the public assembly at
Sparta. It was calculated to impress the assembly, not by appeal
to recent or particular misdeeds, but by the general system of
unprincipled and endless aggression which was imputed to Athens
during the past,—and by the certainty held out that the same system,
unless put down by measures of decisive hostility, would be pushed
still farther in future to the utter ruin of Peloponnesus. And to
this point did the Athenian envoy—staying in Sparta about some
other negotiation, and now present in the assembly—address himself
in reply, after having asked and obtained permission from the
magistrates. The empire of Athens was now of such standing that the
younger men present had no personal knowledge of the circumstances
under which it had grown up: and what was needed as information for
them would be impressive as a reminder even to their seniors.<a
id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[p. 85]</span></p> <p>He
began by disclaiming all intention of defending his native city
against the charges of specific wrong or alleged infractions of
the existing truce: this was no part of his mission, nor did he
recognize Sparta as a competent judge in disputes between Athens
and Corinth. But he nevertheless thought it his duty to vindicate
Athens against the general character of injustice and aggression
imputed to her, as well as to offer a solemn warning to the Spartans
against the policy towards which they were obviously tending. He
then proceeded to show that the empire of Athens had been honorably
earned and amply deserved,—that it had been voluntarily ceded,
and even pressed upon her,—and that she could not abdicate it
without emperiling her own separate existence and security. Far
from thinking that the circumstances under which it was acquired
needed apology, he appealed to them with pride as a testimony of the
genuine Hellenic patriotism of that city which the Spartan congress
now seemed disposed to run down as an enemy.<a id="FNanchor_139"
href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> He then dwelt upon
the circumstances attending the Persian invasion, setting forth the
superior forwardness and the unflinching endurance of Athens, in
spite of ungenerous neglect from Sparta and the other Greeks,—the
preponderance of her naval force in the entire armament,—the
directing genius of her general Themistoklês, complimented even by
Sparta herself,—and the title of Athens to rank on that memorable
occasion as the principal saviour of Greece. This alone ought to
save her empire from reproach: but this was not all,—for that empire
had been tendered to her by the pressing instance of the allies,
at a time when Sparta had proved herself both incompetent and
unwilling to prosecute the war against Persia.<a id="FNanchor_140"
href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> By simple exercise of
the constraining force inseparable from her presidential obligations,
and by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[p. 86]</span>
reduction of various allies who revolted, Athens had gradually
become unpopular, while Sparta too had become her enemy instead of
her friend. To relax her hold upon her allies would have been to
make them the allies of Sparta against her; and thus the motive
of fear was added to those of ambition and revenue, in inducing
Athens to maintain her imperial dominion by force. In her position,
no Grecian power either would or could have acted otherwise: no
Grecian power, certainly not Sparta, would have acted with so much
equity and moderation, or given so little ground of complaint to
her subjects. Worse they <i>had</i> suffered, while under Persia; worse
they <i>would</i> suffer, if they came under Sparta, who held her own
allies under the thraldom of an oligarchical party in each city; and
if they hated Athens, this was only because subjects always hated
the <i>present</i> dominion, whatever that might be.<a id="FNanchor_141"
href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p>Having justified both the origin and the working of the Athenian
empire, the envoy concluded by warning Sparta to consider calmly,
without being hurried away by the passions and invectives of others,
before she took a step from which there was no retreat, and which
exposed the future to chances such as no man on either side could
foresee. He called on her not to break the truce mutually sworn to,
but to adjust all differences, as Athens was prepared to do, by the
amicable arbitration which that truce provided. Should she begin
war, the Athenians would follow her lead and resist her, calling
to witness those gods under whose sanction the oaths were taken.<a
id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<p>The facts recounted in the preceding chapters will have shown,
that the account given by the Athenian envoy at Sparta, of the origin
and character of the empire exercised by his city, though doubtless
the account of a partisan, is in substance correct and equitable;
the envoys of Athens had not yet learned to take the tone which they
assumed in the sixteenth and seventeenth years<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_87">[p. 87]</span> of the coming war, at Melos and Kamarina.
At any time previous to the affair of Korkyra, the topics insisted
upon by the Athenian would probably have been profoundly listened
to at Sparta. But now the mind of the Spartans was made up. Having
cleared the assembly of all “strangers,” and even all allies, they
proceeded to discuss and determine the question among themselves.
Most of their speakers held but one language,<a id="FNanchor_143"
href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>—expatiating on the
wrongs already done by Athens, and urging the necessity of instant
war. There was, however, one voice, and that a commanding voice,
raised against this conclusion: the ancient and respected king
Archidamus opposed it.</p>

<p>The speech of Archidamus is that of a deliberate Spartan, who,
setting aside both hatred to Athens and blind partiality to allies,
looks at the question with a view to the interests and honor of
Sparta only,—not, however, omitting her imperial as well as her
separate character. The preceding native speakers, indignant
against Athens, had probably appealed to Spartan pride, treating
it as an intolerable disgrace that almost the entire land-force
of Dorian Peloponnesus should be thus bullied by one single Ionic
city, and should hesitate to commence a war which one invasion of
Attica would probably terminate. As the Corinthians had tried to
excite the Spartans by well-timed taunts and reproaches, so the
subsequent speakers had aimed at the same objects by panegyric
upon the well-known valor and discipline of the city. To all
these arguments Archidamus set himself to reply. Invoking the
experience of the elders his contemporaries around him, he impressed
upon the assembly the grave responsibility, the uncertainties,
difficulties, and perils, of the war into which they were hurrying
without preparation.<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144"
class="fnanchor">[144]</a> He reminded them of the wealth, the
population, greater than that of any other Grecian city, the naval
force, the cavalry, the hoplites, the large foreign dominion of
Athens,—and then asked by what means they proposed to put her down?<a
id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>
Ships, they had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[p. 88]</span>
few; trained seamen, yet fewer; wealth, next to none. They could
indeed invade and ravage Attica, by their superior numbers and
land-force: but the Athenians had possessions abroad sufficient to
enable them to dispense with the produce of Attica, while their
great navy would retaliate the like ravages upon Peloponnesus.
To suppose that one or two devastating expeditions into Attica
would bring the war to an end, would be a deplorable error: such
proceedings would merely enrage the Athenians, without impairing
their real strength, and the war would thus be prolonged, perhaps,
for a whole generation.<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146"
class="fnanchor">[146]</a> Before they determined upon war, it was
absolutely necessary to provide more efficient means for carrying
it on; and to multiply their allies, not merely among the Greeks,
but among foreigners also: while this was in process, envoys ought
to be sent to Athens to remonstrate and obtain redress for the
grievances of the allies. If the Athenians granted this,—which they
very probably would do, when they saw the preparations going forward,
and when the ruin of the highly-cultivated soil of Attica was held
over them <i>in terrorem</i> without being actually consummated,—so much
the better: if they refused, in the course of two or three years war
might be commenced with some hopes of success. Archidamus reminded
his countrymen that their allies would hold <i>them</i> responsible for
the good or bad issue of what was now determined;<a id="FNanchor_147"
href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> admonishing them,
in the true spirit of a conservative Spartan, to cling to that
cautious policy which had been ever the characteristic of the state,
despising both taunts on their tardiness and panegyric on their
valor. “We, Spartans, owe both our bravery and our prudence to our
admirable public discipline: it makes us warlike, because the sense
of shame is most closely connected with discipline, as valor is with
the sense of shame: it makes us prudent, because our training keeps
us too ignorant to set ourselves above our own institutions, and
holds us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[p. 89]</span> under
sharp restraint so as not to disobey them.<a id="FNanchor_148"
href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> And thus, not being
overwise in unprofitable accomplishments, we Spartans are not given
to disparage our enemy’s strength in clever speech, and then meet
him with short-comings in reality: we think that the capacity of
neighboring states is much on a par, and that the chances in reserve
for both parties are too uncertain to be discriminated beforehand
by speech. We always make real preparations against our enemies, as
if they were proceeding wisely on their side: we must count upon
security through our own precautions, not upon the chance of their
errors. Indeed, there is no great superiority in one man as compared
with another: he is the stoutest who is trained in the severest
trials. Let us, for our parts, not renounce this discipline, which
we have received from our fathers, and which we still continue, to
our very great profit: let us not hurry on, in one short hour, a
resolution upon which depend so many lives, so much property, so many
cities, and our own reputation besides. Let us take time to consider,
since our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[p. 90]</span> strength
puts it fully in our power to do so. Send envoys to the Athenians
on the subject of Potidæa, and of the other grievances alleged by
our allies,—and that too, the rather as they are ready to give us
satisfaction: against one who offers satisfaction, custom forbids
you to proceed, without some previous application, as if he were
a proclaimed wrong-doer. But, at the same time, make preparation
for war; such will be the course of policy at once the best for
your own power and the most terror-striking to your enemies.”<a
id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<p>The speech of Archidamus was not only in itself full of plain
reason and good sense, but delivered altogether from the point
of view of a Spartan; appealing greatly to Spartan conservative
feeling and even prejudice. But in spite of all this, and in spite
of the personal esteem entertained for the speaker, the tide of
feeling in the opposite direction was at that moment irresistible.
Stheneläidas—one of the five ephors, to whom it fell to put the
question for voting—closed the debate; and his few words mark at
once the character of the man, the temper of the assembly, and the
simplicity of speech, though without the wisdom of judgment, for
which Archidamus had taken credit to his countrymen.</p>

<p>“I don’t understand (he said) these long speeches of the
Athenians. They have praised themselves abundantly, but they have
never rebutted what is laid to their charge,—that they are guilty of
wrong against our allies and against Peloponnesus. Now, if in former
days they were good men against the Persians, and are now evil-doers
against us, they deserve double punishment, as having become
evil-doers instead of good.<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150"
class="fnanchor">[150]</a> But <i>we</i> are the same now as we were
then: we know better than to sit still while our allies are
suffering wrong: we shall not adjourn our aid while they cannot
adjourn their sufferings.<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151"
class="fnanchor">[151]</a> Others have in<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_91">[p. 91]</span> abundance wealth, ships, and horses,—but
<i>we</i> have good allies, whom we are not to abandon to the mercy of
the Athenians: nor are we to trust our redress to arbitration and to
words, when our wrongs are not confined to words. We must help them
speedily and with all our strength. Nor let any one tell us that we
can with honor deliberate when we are actually suffering wrong,—it
is rather for those who intend to do the wrong, to deliberate well
beforehand. Resolve upon war then, Lacedæmonians, in a manner worthy
of Sparta: suffer not the Athenians to become greater than they are:
let us not betray our allies to ruin, but march, with the aid of the
gods, against the wrong-doers.”</p>

<p>With these few words, so well calculated to defeat the prudential
admonitions of Archidamus, Stheneläidas put the question for the
decision of the assembly,—which, at Sparta, was usually taken neither
by show of hands nor by deposit of balls in an urn, but by cries
analogous to the Aye or No of the English House of Commons,—the
presiding ephor declaring which of the cries predominated. On
this occasion the cry for war was manifestly the stronger:<a
id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>
yet Stheneläidas affected inability to determine which of the two
cries was the louder, in order that he might have an excuse for
bringing about a more impressive manifestation of sentiment and a
stronger apparent majority,—since a portion of the minority would
probably be afraid to show their real opinions as individuals
openly. He accordingly directed a division, like the Speaker of the
English House of Commons, when his decision in favor of aye or no
is questioned by any member: “Such of you as think that the truce
has been violated, and that the Athenians are doing us wrong, go to
<i>that</i> side; such as think the contrary, to the other side.” The
assembly accordingly divided, and the majority was very great on the
warlike side of the question.</p>

<p>The first step of the Lacedæmonians, after coming to this
important decision was, to send to Delphi and inquire of the oracle
whether it would be beneficial to them to undertake the war: the
answer brought back (Thucydidês seems hardly certain that<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[p. 92]</span> it was really given<a
id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>)
was,—that if they did their best they would be victorious, and that
the god would help them, invoked or uninvoked. They at the same
time convened a general congress of their allies at Sparta, for the
purpose of submitting their recent resolution to the vote of all.</p>

<p>To the Corinthians, in their anxiety for the relief of Potidæa,
the decision of this congress was not less important than that which
the Spartans had just taken separately: and they sent round envoys
to each of the allies, entreating them to authorize war without
reserve. Through such instigations, acting upon the general impulse
then prevalent, the congress came together in a temper decidedly
warlike: most of the speakers were full of invective against Athens,
and impatient for action, while the Corinthians, waiting as before to
speak the last, wound up the discussion by a speech well calculated
to insure a hearty vote. Their former speech had been directed to
shame, exasperate, and alarm the Lacedæmonians: this point had now
been carried, and they had to enforce, upon the allies generally,
the dishonor as well as the impolicy of receding from a willing
leader. The cause was one in which all were interested, the inland
states not less than the maritime, for both would find themselves
ultimately victims of the encroaching despot city: whatever efforts
were necessary for the war, ought cheerfully to be made, since it was
only through war that they could arrive at a secure and honorable
peace. There were good hopes that this might soon be attained, and
that the war would not last long,—so decided was the superiority
of the confederacy, in numbers, in military skill, and in the
equal heart and obedience of all its members.<a id="FNanchor_154"
href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> The<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[p. 93]</span> naval superiority of
Athens depended chiefly upon hired seamen,—and the confederacy, by
borrowing from the treasuries of Delphi and Olympia, would soon be
able to overbid her, take into pay her best mariners, and equal her
equipment at sea: they would excite revolt among her allies, and
establish a permanent fortified post for the ruin of Attica. To make
up a common fund for this purpose, was indispensably necessary; for
Athens was far more than a match for each of them single-handed, and
nothing less than hearty union could save them all from successive
enslavement,—the very supposition of which was intolerable to
Peloponnesian freemen, whose fathers had liberated Greece from the
Persian. Let them not shrink from endurance and sacrifice in such a
cause,—it was their hereditary pride to purchase success by laborious
effort. The Delphian god had promised them his coöperation; and the
whole of Greece would sympathize in the cause, either from fear of
the despotism of Athens, or from hopes of profit. They would not be
the first to break the truce, for the Athenians had already broken
it, as the declaration of the Delphian god distinctly implied.
Let them lose no time in sending aid to the Potidæans, a Dorian
population now besieged by Ionians, as well as to those other Greeks
whom Athens had enslaved. Every day the necessity for effort was
becoming stronger, and the longer it was delayed, the more painful it
would be when it came. “Be ye persuaded then, (concluded the orator),
that this city, which has constituted herself despot of Greece, has
her position against all of us alike, some for present rule, others
for future conquest; let us assail and subdue her, that we may
dwell securely ourselves hereafter, and may emancipate those Greeks
who are now in slavery.”<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155"
class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

<p>If there were any speeches delivered at this congress in
opposition to the war, they were not likely to be successful in
a cause wherein even Archidamus had failed. After the Corinthian
had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[p. 94]</span> concluded,
the question was put to the deputies of every city, great and
small, indiscriminately and the majority decided for war.<a
id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>
This important resolution was adopted about the end of
432 <small>B.C.</small>, or the beginning of January 431
<small>B.C.</small>: the previous decision of the Spartans separately
may have been taken about two months earlier, in the preceding
October or November 432 <small>B.C.</small></p>

<p>Reviewing the conduct of the two great Grecian parties at this
momentous juncture, with reference to existing treaties and positive
grounds of complaint, it seems clear that Athens was in the right.
She had done nothing which could fairly be called a violation of the
thirty years’ truce: and for such of her acts as were alleged to be
such, she offered to submit them to that amicable arbitration which
the truce itself prescribed. The Peloponnesian confederates were
manifestly the aggressors in the contest; and if Sparta, usually
so backward, now came forward in a spirit so decidedly opposite,
we are to ascribe it partly to her standing fear and jealousy
of Athens, partly to the pressure of her allies, especially of
the Corinthians. Thucydidês, recognizing these two as the grand
determining motives, and indicating the alleged infractions of truce
as simple occasions or pretexts, seems to consider the fear and
hatred of Athens as having contributed more to determine Sparta than
the urgency of her allies.<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157"
class="fnanchor">[157]</a> That the extraordinary aggrandizement
of Athens, during the period immediately succeeding the Persian
invasion, was well calculated to excite alarm and jealousy in
Peloponnesus, is indisputable: but if we take Athens as she stood in
432 <small>B.C.</small>, it deserves notice that she had
neither made, nor, so far as we know, tried to make, a single new
acquisition during the whole fourteen years which had elapsed since
the conclusion of the thirty years’ truce;<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_95">[p. 95]</span><a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158"
class="fnanchor">[158]</a>— and, moreover, that that truce marked
an epoch of signal humiliation and reduction of her power. The
triumph which Sparta and the Peloponnesians then gained, though
not sufficiently complete to remove all fear of Athens, was yet
great enough to inspire them with the hope that a second combined
effort would subdue her. This mixture of fear and hope was exactly
the state of feeling out of which war was likely to grow,—and we
see that even before the quarrel between Corinth and Korkyra,
sagacious Greeks everywhere anticipated war as not far distant:<a
id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>
it was near breaking out even on occasion of the revolt of Samos,<a
id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>
and peace was then preserved partly by the commercial and nautical
interests of Corinth, partly by the quiescence of Athens. But the
quarrel of Corinth and Korkyra, which Sparta might have appeased
beforehand had she thought it her interest to do so,—and the junction
of Korkyra with Athens,—exhibited the latter as again in a career
of aggrandizement, and thus again brought into play the warlike
feelings of Sparta; while they converted Corinth from the advocate of
peace into a clamorous organ of war. The revolt of Potidæa,—fomented
by Corinth, and encouraged by Sparta in the form of a positive
promise to invade<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[p. 96]</span>
Attica,—was, in point of fact, the first distinct violation of the
truce, and the initiatory measure of the Peloponnesian war: nor did
the Spartan meeting, and the subsequent congress of allies at Sparta,
serve any other purpose than to provide such formalities as were
requisite to insure the concurrent and hearty action of numbers, and
to clothe with imposing sanction a state of war already existing in
reality, though yet unproclaimed. The sentiment in Peloponnesus at
this moment was not the fear of Athens, but the hatred of Athens,—and
the confident hope of subduing her. And indeed such confidence
was justified by plausible grounds: men might well think that the
Athenians would never endure the entire devastation of their highly
cultivated soil,—or at least that they would certainly come forth
to fight for it in the field, which was all that the Peloponnesians
desired. Nothing except the unparalleled ascendency and unshaken
resolution of Periklês, induced the Athenians to persevere in a
scheme of patient defence, and to trust to that naval superiority
which the enemies of Athens, save and except the judicious
Archidamus, had not yet learned fully to appreciate. Moreover, the
confident hopes of the Peloponnesians were materially strengthened
by the wide-spread sympathy in favor of their cause, proclaiming,
as it did, the intended liberation of Greece from a despot city.<a
id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

<p>To Athens, on the other hand, the coming war presented itself in
a very different aspect; holding out scarcely any hope of possible
gain, and the certainty of prodigious loss and privation,—even
granting, that, at this heavy cost, her independence and union at
home, and her empire abroad, could be upheld. By Periklês, and by
the more long-sighted Athenians, the chance of unavoidable war was
foreseen even before the Korkyræan dispute.<a id="FNanchor_162"
href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> But Periklês was only
the first citizen in a democracy, esteemed, trusted, and listened
to, more than any one else by the body of the citizens, but warmly
opposed in most of his measures, under the free speech and latitude
of individual action which reigned at Athens,—and even bitterly
hated by many active political opponents. The formal determination
of the Lacedæmonians, to declare war, must of course have been made
known at Athens<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[p. 97]</span>
by those Athenian envoys, who had entered an unavailing protest
against it in the Spartan assembly. No steps were taken by Sparta
to carry this determination into effect until after the congress of
allies and their pronounced confirmatory vote. Nor did the Spartans
even then send any herald, or make any formal declaration. They
despatched various propositions to Athens, not at all with a view of
trying to obtain satisfaction, or of providing some escape from the
probability of war; but with the contrary purpose,—of multiplying
demands, and enlarging the grounds of quarrel.<a id="FNanchor_163"
href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> Meanwhile, the
deputies retiring home from the congress to their respective cities,
carried with them the general resolution for immediate warlike
preparations to be made, with as little delay as possible.<a
id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></p>

<p>The first requisition addressed by the Lacedæmonians to Athens
was a political manœuvre aimed at Periklês, their chief opponent in
that city. His mother, Agaristê, belonged to the great family of the
Alkmæônids, who were supposed to be under an inexpiable hereditary
taint, in consequence of the sacrilege committed by their ancestor
Megaklês, nearly two centuries before, in the slaughter of the
Kylonian suppliants near the altar of the Venerable Goddesses.<a
id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>
Ancient as this transaction was, it still had sufficient hold on the
mind of the Athenians to serve as the basis of a political manœuvre:
about seventy-seven years before, shortly after the expulsion of
Hippias from Athens, it had been so employed by the Spartan king
Kleomenês, who at that time exacted from the Athenians a clearance
of the ancient sacrilege, to be effected by the banishment of
Kleisthenês, the founder of the democracy, and his chief partisans.
This demand, addressed by Kleomenês to the Athenians, at the
instance of Isagoras, the rival of Kleisthenês,<a id="FNanchor_166"
href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> had been then obeyed,
and had served well the purposes of those who sent it; a similar
blow was now aimed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[p. 98]</span>
by the Lacedæmonians at Periklês, the grand nephew of Kleisthenês,
and doubtless at the instance of his political enemies: religion
required, it was pretended, that “the abomination of the goddess
should be driven out.”<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167"
class="fnanchor">[167]</a> If the Athenians complied with this
demand, they would deprive themselves, at this critical moment, of
their ablest leader; but the Lacedæmonians, not expecting compliance,
reckoned at all events upon discrediting Periklês with the people, as
being partly the cause of the war through family taint of impiety,<a
id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>—and
this impression would doubtless be loudly proclaimed by his political
opponents in the assembly.</p>

<p>The influence of Periklês with the Athenian public had become
greater and greater as their political experience of him was
prolonged. But the bitterness of his enemies appears to have
increased along with it; and not long before this period, he had been
indirectly assailed, through the medium of accusations against three
different persons, all more or less intimate with him,—his mistress
Aspasia, the philosopher Anaxagoras, and the sculptor Pheidias. We
cannot make out either the exact date, or the exact facts, of either
of these accusations. Aspasia, daughter of Axiochus, was a native
of Milêtus, beautiful, well educated, and ambitious. She resided
at Athens, and is affirmed, though upon very doubtful evidence, to
have kept slave-girls to be let out as courtezans; whatever may
be the case with this report, which is most probably one of the
scandals engendered by political animosity against Periklês,<a
id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>
it is certain that so re<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[p.
99]</span>markable were her own fascinations, her accomplishments,
and her powers, not merely of conversation, but even of oratory
and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[p. 100]</span>
criticism,—that the most distinguished Athenians of all ages and
characters, Sokratês among the number, visited her, and several
of them took their wives along with them to hear her also. The
free citizen women of Athens lived in strict and almost oriental
recluseness, as well after being married as when single: everything
which concerned their lives, their happiness, or their rights, was
determined or managed for them by male relatives: and they seem
to have been destitute of all mental culture and accomplishments.
Their society presented no charm nor interest, which men accordingly
sought for in the company of the class of women called hetæræ, or
courtezans, literally female companions; who lived a free life,
managed their own affairs, and supported themselves by their powers
of pleasing. These women were numerous, and were doubtless of
every variety of personal character: but the most distinguished
and superior among them, such as Aspasia and Theodotê,<a
id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a>
appear to have been the only women in Greece, except the Spartan, who
either inspired strong passion or exercised mental ascendency.</p>

<p>Periklês had been determined in his choice of a wife by those
family considerations which were held almost obligatory at
Athens, and had married a woman very nearly related to him, by
whom he had two sons, Xanthippus and Paralus. But the marriage,
having never been comfortable, was afterwards dissolved by mutual
consent, according to that full liberty of divorce which the
Attic law permitted; and Periklês concurred with his wife’s male
relations, who formed her legal guardians, in giving her a way
to another husband.<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171"
class="fnanchor">[171]</a> He then took Aspasia to live with
him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[p. 101]</span> had a son
by her, who bore his name, and continued ever afterwards on terms
of the greatest intimacy and affection with her. Without adopting
those exaggerations which represent Aspasia as having communicated
to Periklês his distinguished eloquence, or even as having herself
composed orations for public delivery, we may well believe her to
have been qualified to take interest and share in that literary and
philosophical society which frequented the house of Periklês, and
which his unprincipled son Xanthippus,—disgusted with his father’s
regular expenditure, as withholding from him the means of supporting
an extravagant establishment,—reported abroad with exaggerating
calumnies and turned into derision. It was from that worthless
young man, who died of the Athenian epidemic during the lifetime
of Periklês, that his political enemies and the comic writers of
the day were mainly furnished with scandalous anecdotes to assail
the private habits of this distinguished man.<a id="FNanchor_172"
href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> The comic writers
attacked him for alleged intrigues with different women, but the
name of Aspasia they treated as public property, without any mercy
or reserve: she was the Omphalê, the Deianeira, or the Hêrê, to
this great Hêraklês or Zeus of Athens. At length one of these
comic writers, Hermippus, not contented with scenic attacks,
indicted her before the dikastery for impiety, as participant in
the philosophical discussions held, and the opinions professed,
in the society of Periklês, by Anaxagoras and others. Against
Anaxagoras himself, too, a similar indictment is said to have been
preferred, either by Kleon or by Thucydidês, son of Melêsias, under
a general resolution recently passed in the public assembly, at
the instance of Diopeithês. And such was the sensitive antipathy
of the Athenian public, shown afterwards fatally in the case of
Sokratês, and embittered in this instance by all the artifices of
political faction, against philosophers whose opinions conflicted
with the received religious dogmas, that Periklês did not dare to
place Anaxagoras on his trial: the latter retired from Athens, and
the sentence of banishment was passed against him in his absence.<a
id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>
But he himself defended Aspasia before<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_102">[p. 102]</span> the diakastery: in fact, the indictment
was as much against him as against her: one thing alleged against
her, and also against Pheidias, was, the reception of free women to
facilitate the intrigues of Periklês. He defended her successfully,
and procured a verdict of acquittal: but we are not surprised to
hear that his speech was marked by the strongest personal emotions,
and even by tears.<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174"
class="fnanchor">[174]</a> The dikasts were accustomed to such
appeals to their sympathies, sometimes even to extravagant excess,
from ordinary accused persons: but in Periklês, so manifest an
outburst of emotion stands out as something quite unparalleled:
for constant self-mastery was one of the most prominent features
in his character.<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175"
class="fnanchor">[175]</a> And we shall find him near the close of
his political life, when he had become for the moment unpopular
with the Athenian people, distracted as they were at the moment
with the terrible sufferings of the pestilence,—bearing up against
their unmerited anger not merely with dignity, but with a pride of
conscious innocence and desert which rises almost into defiance;
insomuch that the rhetor Dionysius, who criticizes the speech
of Periklês as if it were simply the composition of Thucydidês,
censures that historian for having violated dramatic propriety by
a display of insolence where humility would have been becoming.<a
id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>

<p>It appears, also, as far as we can judge amidst very imperfect
data, that the trial of the great sculptor Pheidias, for alleged
embezzlement in the contract for his celebrated gold and ivory
statue of Athênê,<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177"
class="fnanchor">[177]</a> took place nearly at this period. That
statue had been finished and dedicated in the Parthenon in 437
<small>B.C.</small>, since which period Pheidias had
been engaged at Olympia, in his last and great masterpiece, the
colossal statue of the Olym<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[p.
103]</span>pian Zeus. On his return to Athens from the execution
of this work, about 433 or 432 <small>B.C.</small>,
the accusation of embezzlement was instituted against him
by the political enemies of Periklês.<a id="FNanchor_178"
href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> A slave of Pheidias,
named Menon, planted himself as a suppliant at the altar, professing
to be cognizant of certain facts which proved that his master had
committed peculation. Motion was made to receive his depositions,
and to insure to his person the protection of the people; upon which
he revealed various statements impeaching the pecuniary probity of
Pheidias, and the latter was put in prison, awaiting the day for his
trial before the dikastery. The gold employed and charged for in the
statue, however, was all capable of being taken off and weighed, so
as to verify its accuracy, which Periklês dared the accusers to do.
Besides the charge of embezzlement, there were other circumstances
which rendered Pheidias unpopular: it had been discovered that, in
the reliefs on the friese of the Parthenon, he had introduced the
portraits both of himself and of Periklês in conspicuous positions.
It seems that Pheidias died in prison before the day of trial;
and some even said, that he had been poisoned by the enemies of
Periklês, in order that the suspicions against the latter, who
was the real object of attack, might be aggravated. It is said
also that Drakontidês proposed and carried a decree in the public
assembly, that Periklês should be called on to give an account of
the money which he had expended, and that the dikasts, before whom
the account was rendered, should give their suffrage in the most
solemn manner from the altar: this latter provision was modified
by Agnon, who, while proposing that the dikasts should be fifteen
hundred in number, retained the vote by pebbles in the urn according
to ordinary custom.<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179"
class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p>

<p>If Periklês was ever tried on such a charge, there can be no doubt
that he was honorably acquitted: for the language of Thucydidês
respecting his pecuniary probity is such as could never have been
employed if a verdict of guilty on a charge of peculation had
ever been publicly pronounced. But we cannot be certain that he
ever was tried: indeed, another accusation<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_104">[p. 104]</span> urged by his enemies, and even by
Aristophanês, in the sixth year of the Peloponnesian war, implies
that no trial took place: for it was alleged that Periklês, in
order to escape this danger, “blew up the Peloponnesian war,”
and involved his country in such confusion and peril as made his
own aid and guidance indispensably necessary to her: especially
that he passed the decree against the Megarians by which the war
was really brought on.<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180"
class="fnanchor">[180]</a> We know enough, however, to be certain
that such a supposition is altogether inadmissible. The enemies of
Periklês were far too eager, and too expert in Athenian political
warfare, to have let him escape by such a stratagem: moreover, we
learn from the assurance of Thucydidês, that the war depended upon
far deeper causes,—that the Megarian decree was in no way the real
cause of it,—that it was not Periklês, but the Peloponnesians,
who brought it on, by the blow struck at Potidæa.</p> <p><span
class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[p. 105]</span></p> <p>All that we
can make out, amidst these uncertified allegations, is, that in the
year or two immediately preceding the Peloponnesian war, Periklês
was hard pressed by the accusations of political enemies,—perhaps
even in his own person, but certainly in the persons of those who
were most in his confidence and affection.<a id="FNanchor_181"
href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> And it was in this
turn of his political position that the Lacedæmonians sent to
Athens the above-mentioned requisition, that the ancient Kylonian
sacrilege might be at length cleared out; in other words, that
Periklês and his family might be banished. Doubtless, his enemies,
as well as the partisans of Lacedæmon at Athens, would strenuously
support this proposition: and the party of Lacedæmon at Athens
was always strong, even during the middle of the war: to act as
proxenus to the Lacedæmonians was accounted an honor even by the
greatest Athenian families.<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182"
class="fnanchor">[182]</a> On this occasion, however, the manœuvre
did not succeed, nor did the Athenians listen to the requisition for
banishing the sacrilegious Alkmæônids. On the contrary, they replied
that the Spartans, too, had an account of sacrilege to clear off;
for they had violated the sanctuary of Poseidon, at Cape Tænarus,
in dragging from it some helot suppliants to be put to death,—and
the sanctuary of Athênê Chalkiœkus at Sparta, in blocking up and
starving to death the guilty regent Pausanias. To require that
Laconia might be cleared of these two acts of sacrilege, was the
only answer which the Athenians made to the demand sent for the
banishment of Periklês.<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183"
class="fnanchor">[183]</a> Probably, the actual effect of that demand
was, to strengthen him in the public esteem:<a id="FNanchor_184"
href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> very different from
the effect of the same manœuvre when practised before by Kleomenês
against Kleisthenês.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[p. 106]</span></p>

<p>Other Spartan envoys shortly afterwards arrived, with fresh
demands. The Athenians were now required: 1. To withdraw their
troops from Potidæa. 2. To replace Ægina in its autonomy. 3. To
repeal the decree of exclusion against the Megarians. It was upon
the latter that the greatest stress was laid; an intimation being
held out that war might be avoided if such repeal were granted. We
see plainly, from this proceeding, that the Lacedæmonians acted in
concert with the anti-Periklêan leaders at Athens. To Sparta and her
confederacy the decree against the Megarians was of less importance
than the rescue of the Corinthian troops now blocked up in Potidæa:
but on the other hand, the party opposed to Periklês would have much
better chance of getting a vote of the assembly against him on the
subject of the Megarians: and this advantage, if gained, would serve
to enfeeble his influence generally. No concession was obtained,
however, on either of the three points: even in respect to Megara,
the decree of exclusion was vindicated and upheld against all the
force of opposition. At length the Lacedæmonians—who had already
resolved upon war, and had sent these envoys in mere compliance
with the exigencies of ordinary practice, not with any idea of
bringing about an accommodation—sent a third batch of envoys with a
proposition, which at least had the merit of disclosing their real
purpose without disguise. Rhamphias and two other Spartans announced
to the Athenians the simple injunction: “The Lacedæmonians wish the
peace to stand; and it <i>may</i> stand, if you will leave the Greeks
autonomous.” Upon this demand, so very different from the preceding,
the Athenians resolved to hold a fresh assembly on the subject of
war or peace, to open the whole question anew for discussion, and to
determine, once for all, on a peremptory answer.<a id="FNanchor_185"
href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a></p>

<p>The last demands presented on the part of Sparta, which went
to nothing less than the entire extinction of the Athenian
empire,—combined with the character, alike wavering and insin<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[p. 107]</span>cere, of the demands
previously made, and with the knowledge that the Spartan confederacy
had pronounced peremptorily in favor of war,—seemed likely to produce
unanimity at Athens, and to bring together this important assembly
under the universal conviction that war was inevitable. Such,
however, was not the fact. The reluctance to go to war was sincere
amidst the large majority of the assembly; while among a considerable
portion of them it was so preponderant, that they even now reverted
to the opening which the Lacedæmonians had before held out about the
anti-Megarian decree, as if that were the chief cause of war. There
was much difference of opinion among the speakers, several of whom
insisted upon the repeal of this decree, treating it as a matter far
too insignificant to go to war about, and denouncing the obstinacy of
Periklês for refusing to concede such a trifle.<a id="FNanchor_186"
href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> Against this
opinion Periklês entered his protest, in an harangue decisive and
encouraging, which Dionysius of Halikarnassus ranks among the best
speeches in Thucydidês: the latter historian may probably himself
have heard the original speech.</p>

<p>“I continue, Athenians, to adhere to the same conviction, that
we must not yield to the Peloponnesians,—though I know that men
are in one mood when they sanction the resolution to go to war,
and in another when actually in the contest,—their judgments then
depending upon the turn of events. I have only to repeat now what
I have said on former occasions,—and I adjure you who follow my
views to adhere to what we jointly resolve, though the result should
be partially unfavorable: or else, not to take credit for wisdom
in the event of success.<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187"
class="fnanchor">[187]</a> For it is very<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_108">[p. 108]</span> possible that the contingencies of
events may depart more from all reasonable track than the counsels
of man: such are the unexpected turns which we familiarly impute
to fortune. The Lacedæmonians have before now manifested their
hostile aims against us, but on this last occasion more than
ever. While the truce prescribes that we are to give and receive
amicable satisfaction for our differences, and each to retain what
we possess,—they not only have not asked for such satisfaction,
but will not receive it when tendered by us: they choose to settle
complaints by war and not by discussion: they have got beyond the
tone of complaint, and are here already with that of command. For
they enjoin us to withdraw from Potidæa, to leave Ægina free, and
to rescind the decree against the Megarians: nay, these last envoys
are even come to proclaim to us, that we must leave all the Greeks
free. Now let none of you believe, that we shall be going to war
about a trifle, if we refuse to rescind the Megarian decree,—which
they chiefly put forward, as if its repeal would avert the war,—let
none of you take blame to yourselves as if we had gone to war about
a small matter. For this small matter contains in itself the whole
test and trial of your mettle: if ye yield it, ye will presently have
some other greater exaction put upon you, like men who have already
truckled on one point from fear: whereas if ye hold out stoutly, ye
will make it clear to them that they must deal with you more upon
a footing of equality.”<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188"
class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>

<p>Periklês then examined the relative strength of parties and the
chances of war. The Peloponnesians were a self-working population,
with few slaves, and without wealth, either private or public;
they had no means of carrying on distant or long-continued war:
they were ready to expose their persons, but not at all ready
to contribute from their very narrow means:<a id="FNanchor_189"
href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> in a border-war,
or a single land battle, they were invincible, but for systematic
warfare against a power like Athens, they had neither competent
headship, nor habits of concert and punctuality, nor money to
profit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[p. 109]</span> by
opportunities, always rare and accidental, for successful attack.
They might, perhaps, establish a fortified post in Attica, but it
would do little serious mischief; while at sea, their inferiority
and helplessness would be complete, and the irresistible Athenian
navy would take care to keep it so. Nor would they be able to reckon
on tempting away the able foreign seamen from Athenian ships by
means of funds borrowed from Olympia or Delphi:<a id="FNanchor_190"
href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> for besides that
the mariners of the dependent islands would find themselves losers
even by accepting a higher pay, with the certainty of Athenian
vengeance afterwards,—Athens herself would suffice to man her fleet
in case of need, with her own citizens and metics: she had within
her own walls steersmen and mariners better as well as more numerous
than all Greece besides. There was but one side on which Athens
was vulnerable: Attica unfortunately was not an island,—it was
exposed to invasion and ravage. To this the Athenians must submit,
without committing the imprudence of engaging a land battle to
avert it: they had abundant lands out of Attica, insular as well as
continental, to supply their wants, and they could in their turn,
by means of their navy, ravage the Peloponnesian territories, whose
inhabitants had no subsidiary lands to recur to.<a id="FNanchor_191"
href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>

<p>“Mourn not for the loss of land and houses (continued the orator):
reserve your mourning for men: houses and land acquire not men,
but men acquire them.<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192"
class="fnanchor">[192]</a> Nay, if I thought I could prevail upon
you, I would exhort you to march out and ravage them yourselves,
and thus show to the Peloponnesians that, for them at least,
ye will not truckle. And I could exhibit many further grounds
for confidently anticipating success, if ye will only be<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[p. 110]</span> willing not to aim
at increased dominion when we are in the midst of war, and not to
take upon yourselves new self-imposed risks; for I have ever been
more afraid of our own blunders than of the plans of our enemy.<a
id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a>
But these are matters for future discussion, when we come to actual
operations: for the present let us dismiss these envoys with the
answer: That we will permit the Megarians to use our markets and
harbors, if the Lacedæmonians on their side will discontinue their
(xenêlasy or) summary expulsions of ourselves and our allies from
their own territory,—for there is nothing in the truce to prevent
either one or the other: that we will leave the Grecian cities
autonomous, if we <i>had</i> them as autonomous at the time when the truce
was made,—and as soon as the Lacedæmonians shall grant to <i>their</i>
allied cities autonomy such as each of them shall freely choose, not
such as is convenient to Sparta: that while we are ready to give
satisfaction according to the truce, we will not begin war, but
will repel those who do begin it. Such is the reply at once just
and suitable to the dignity of this city. We ought to make up our
minds that war is inevitable: the more cheerfully we accept it, the
less vehement shall we find our enemies in their attack: and where
the danger is greatest, there also is the final honor greatest,
both for a state and for a private citizen. Assuredly our fathers,
when they bore up against the Persians,—having no such means as we
possess to start from, and even compelled to abandon all that they
did possess,—both repelled the invader and brought matters forward
to our actual pitch, more by advised operation than by good fortune,
and by a daring courage greater than their real power. We ought not
to fall short of them: we must keep off our enemies in every way, and
leave an unimpaired power to our successors.”<a id="FNanchor_194"
href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a></p>

<p>These animating encouragements of Periklês carried with them
the majority of the assembly, so that answer was made to the
envoys, such as he recommended, on each of the particular points in
debate. It was announced to them, moreover, on the general<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[p. 111]</span> question of peace
or war, that the Athenians were prepared to discuss all the
grounds of complaint against them, pursuant to the truce, by equal
and amicable arbitration,—but that they would do nothing under
authoritative demand.<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195"
class="fnanchor">[195]</a> With this answer the envoys returned to
Sparta, and an end was put to negotiation.</p>

<p>It seems evident, from the account of Thucydidês, that the
Athenian public was not brought to this resolution without much
reluctance, and great fear of the consequences, especially
destruction of property in Attica: and that a considerable minority
took opposition on the Megarian decree,—the ground skilfully laid by
Sparta for breaking the unanimity of her enemy, and strengthening
the party opposed to Periklês. But we may also decidedly infer from
the same historian,—especially from the proceedings of Corinth and
Sparta, as he sets them forth,—that Athens could not have avoided
the war without such an abnegation, both of dignity and power as
no nation under any government will ever submit to, and as would
have even left her without decent security for her individual
rights. To accept the war tendered to her, was a matter not merely
of prudence but of necessity: the tone of exaction assumed by the
Spartan envoys would have rendered concession a mere evidence of
weakness and fear. As the account of Thucydidês bears out the
judgment of Periklês on this important point,<a id="FNanchor_196"
href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> so it also shows us
that Athens was not less in the right upon the received principles
of international dealing. It was not Athens, as the Spartans<a
id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a>
them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[p. 112]</span>selves
afterwards came to feel, but her enemies, who broke the provisions
of the truce, by encouraging the revolt of Potidæa, and by
promising invasion of Attica: it was not Athens, but her enemies,
who, after thus breaking the truce, made a string of exorbitant
demands, in order to get up as good a case as possible for war.<a
id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a>
The case made out by Periklês, justifying the war on grounds both
of right and prudence, is in all its main points borne out by the
impartial voice of Thucydidês. And though it is perfectly true,
that the ambition of Athens had been great, and the increase of her
power marvellous, during the thirty-five years between the repulse
of Xerxes and the thirty years’ truce,—it is not less true that by
that truce she lost very largely, and that she acquired nothing to
compensate such loss during the fourteen years between the truce and
the Korkyræan alliance. The policy of Periklês had not been one of
foreign aggrandizement, or of increasing vexation and encroachment
towards other Grecian powers: even the Korkyræan alliance was noway
courted by him, and was in truth accepted with paramount regard to
the obligations of the existing truce: while the circumstances out
of which that alliance grew, testify a more forward ambition on the
part of Corinth than on that of Athens, to appropriate to herself
the Korkyræan naval force. It is common to ascribe the Peloponnesian
war to the ambition of Athens, but this is a partial view of the
case. The aggressive sentiment, partly fear, partly hatred, was on
the side of the Peloponnesians, who were not ignorant that Athens
desired the continuance of peace, but were resolved not to let her
stand as she was at the conclusion of the thirty years’ truce; it was
their purpose to attack her and break down her empire, as dangerous,
wrongful, and anti-Hellenic. The war was thus partly a contest of
principle, involving the popular proclamation of the right of every
Grecian state to autonomy, against Athens: partly a contest of power,
wherein Spartan and Corinthian ambition was not less conspicuous, and
far more aggressive in the beginning, than Athenian.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[p. 113]</span></p>

<p>Conformably to what is here said, the first blow of the war
was struck, not by Athens, but against her. After the decisive
answer given to the Spartan envoys, taken in conjunction with the
previous proceedings, and the preparations actually going on among
the Peloponnesian confederacy,—the truce could hardly be said to be
still in force, though there was no formal proclamation of rupture.
A few weeks passed in restricted and mistrustful intercourse;<a
id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a>
though individuals who passed the borders did not think it necessary
to take a herald with them, as in time of actual war. Had the excess
of ambition been on the side of Athens compared with her enemies,
this was the time for her to strike the first blow, carrying with it
of course great probability of success, before their preparations
were completed. But she remained strictly within the limits of the
truce, and the disastrous series of mutual aggressions, destined to
tear in pieces the entrails of Hellas, was opened by her enemy and
her neighbor.</p>

<p>The little town of Platæa, still hallowed by the memorable victory
over the Persians, as well as by the tutelary consecration received
from Pausanias, was the scene of this unforeseen enterprise. It stood
in Bœotia, immediately north of Kithæron; on the borders of Attica
on one side, and of the Theban territory on the other, from which it
was separated by the river Asôpus: the distance between Platæa and
Thebes being about seventy stadia, or a little more than eight miles.
Though Bœotian by descent, the Platæans were completely separated
from the Bœotian league, and in hearty alliance, as well as qualified
communion of civil rights, with the Athenians, who had protected
them against the bitter enmity of Thebes, for a period of time now
nearly three generations. But in spite of this long prescription,
the Thebans, as chiefs of the Bœotian league, still felt themselves
wronged by the separation of Platæa: and an oligarchical faction
of wealthy Platæans espoused their cause,<a id="FNanchor_200"
href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> with a<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[p. 114]</span> view of subverting the
democratical government of the town, of destroying its leaders, their
political rivals, and of establishing an oligarchy with themselves
as the chiefs. Naukleidês, and others of this faction, entered into
a secret conspiracy with Eurymachus and the oligarchy of Thebes:
to both it appeared a tempting prize, since war was close at hand,
to take advantage of this ambiguous interval, before watches had
been placed, and the precautions of a state of war commenced, and
to surprise the town of Platæa in the night: moreover, a period
of religious festival was chosen, in order that the population
might be most completely off their guard.<a id="FNanchor_201"
href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> Accordingly, on a
rainy night towards the close of March 431 <small>B.C.</small>,<a
id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> a
body of rather more than three hundred Theban hoplites, commanded
by two of the Bœotarchs, Pythangelus, and Diemporus, and including
Eurymachus in the ranks, presented themselves at the gate of Platæa
during the first sleep of the citizens: Naukleidês and his partisans
opened the gate and conducted them to the agora, which they reached
and occupied in military order without the least resistance. The
best part of the Theban military force was intended to arrive at
Platæa by break of day, in order to support them.<a id="FNanchor_203"
href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[p. 115]</span></p>

<p>Naukleidês and his friends, following the instincts of political
antipathy, were eager to conduct the Thebans to the houses of their
opponents, the democratical leaders, in order that the latter
might be seized or despatched. But to this the Thebans would not
consent: believing themselves now masters of the town, and certain
of a large reinforcement at daylight, they thought they could
overawe the citizens into an apparently willing acquiescence in
their terms, without any actual violence: they wished, moreover,
rather to soften and justify, than to aggravate, the gross public
wrong already committed. Accordingly their herald was directed
to invite, by public proclamation, all Platæans who were willing
to return to their ancient sympathies of race, and to the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[p. 116]</span> Bœotian confederacy,
that they should come forth and take station as brethren in the
armed ranks of the Thebans. And the Platæans, suddenly roused from
sleep by the astounding news that their great enemy was master of
the town, supposed amidst the darkness that the number of assailants
was far greater than the reality: so that in spite of their strong
attachment to Athens, they thought their case hopeless, and began
to open negotiations. But as they soon found out, in spite of the
darkness, as the discussion proceeded, that the real numbers of the
Thebans were not greater than could be dealt with,—they speedily took
courage and determined to attack them; establishing communication
with each other by breaking through the walls of their private
houses, in order that they might not be detected in moving about
in the streets or ways,<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204"
class="fnanchor">[204]</a>—and forming barricades with wagons across
such of these ways as were suitable. A little before daybreak, when
their preparations were fully completed, they sallied forth from
their houses to the attack, and immediately came to close quarters
with the Thebans. The latter, still fancying themselves masters of
the town, and relying upon a satisfactory close to the discussions
when daylight should arrive, now found themselves surprised in their
turn, and under great disadvantages: for they had been out all night
under a heavy rain,—they were in a town which they did not know,
with narrow, crooked, and muddy ways, such as they would have had
difficulty in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[p. 117]</span>
finding even by daylight. Nevertheless, on finding themselves
suddenly assailed, they got as well as they could into close order,
and repelled the Platæans two or three times: but the attack was
still repeated, with loud shouts, while the women also screamed, and
howled, and threw tiles from the flat-roofed houses, until at length
the Thebans became dismayed and broken. But flight was not less
difficult than resistance; for they could not find their way out of
the city, and even the gate by which they entered, the only one open,
had been closed by a Platæan citizen, who thrust into it the point of
a javelin in place of the peg whereby the bar was commonly held fast.
Dispersed about the city, and pursued by men who knew every inch of
the ground, some ran to the top of the wall, and jumped down on the
outside, most of them perished in the attempt,—a few others escaped
through an unguarded gate, by cutting through the bar with a hatchet
which a woman gave to them,—while the greater number of them ran
into the open doors of a large barn or building in conjunction with
the wall, mistaking these doors for an approach to the town-gate.
They were here blocked up without the chance of escape, and the
Platæans at first thought of setting fire to the building: but at
length a convention was concluded, whereby they, as well as all the
other Thebans in the city, agreed to surrender at discretion.<a
id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p>

<p id="two_views">Had the reinforcements from Thebes arrived at
the expected hour, this disaster would have been averted. But the
heavy rain and dark night retarded their whole march, while the
river Asôpus was so much swollen as to be with difficulty fordable:
so that before they reached the gates of Platæa, their comrades
within were either slain or captured. Which fate had befallen them,
the Thebans without could not tell: but they immediately resolved
to seize what they could find, persons as well as property, in the
Platæan territory,—no precautions having been taken as yet to guard
against the perils of war by keeping within the walls,—in order
that they might have something to exchange for such Thebans as were
prisoners. Before this step could be executed, however, a herald
came forth from the town to remonstrate with them upon their unholy
proceeding in having so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[p.
118]</span> flagrantly violated the truce, and especially to warn
them not to do any wrong without the walls. If they retired without
inflicting farther mischief, their prisoners within should be given
up to them; if otherwise, these prisoners would be slain immediately.
A convention having been concluded and sworn to on this basis, the
Thebans retired without any active measures. Such at least was the
Theban account of what preceded their retirement: but the Platæans
gave a very different statement; denying that they had made any
categorical promise or sworn any oath,—and affirming that they had
engaged for nothing, except to suspend any decisive step with regard
to the prisoners until discussion had been entered into to see if a
satisfactory agreement could be concluded.</p>

<p>As Thucydidês records both of these statements, without intimating
to which of the two he himself gave the preference, we may presume
that both of them found credence with respectable persons. The Theban
story is undoubtedly the most probable: but the Platæans appear to
have violated the understanding, even upon their own construction
of it. For no sooner had the Thebans retired, than they (the
Platæans) hastily brought in their citizens and the best of their
movable property within the walls, and then slew all their prisoners
forthwith; without even entering into the formalities of negotiation.
The prisoners thus put to death, among whom was Eurymachus himself,
were one hundred and eighty in number.<a id="FNanchor_206"
href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a></p> <p><span
class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[p. 119]</span></p> <p>On the first
entrance of the Theban assailants at night, a messenger had started
from Platæa to carry the news to Athens: a second messenger followed
him to report the victory and capture of the prisoners, as soon as it
had been achieved. The Athenians sent back a herald without delay,
enjoining the Platæans to take no step respecting the prisoners
until consultation should be had with Athens. Periklês doubtless
feared what turned out to be the fact: for the prisoners had been
slain before his messenger could arrive. Apart from the terms of the
convention, and looking only to the received practice of ancient
warfare, their destruction could not be denounced as unusually
cruel, though the Thebans, when fortune was in their favor, chose
to designate it as such,<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207"
class="fnanchor">[207]</a>—but impartial contemporaries would
notice, and the Athenians in particular would deeply lament, the
glaring impolicy of the act. For Thebes, the best thing of all
would of course be to get back her captured citizens forthwith:
but next to that, the least evil would be to hear that they had
been put to death. In the hands of the Athenians and Platæans, they
would have been the means of obtaining from her much more valuable
sacrifices than their lives, considered as a portion of Theban power,
were worth: so strong was the feeling of sympathy for imprisoned
citizens, several of them men of rank and importance,—as may be seen
by the past conduct of Athens after the battle of Korôneia, and
by that of Sparta, hereafter to be recounted, after the taking of
Sphakteria. The Platæans, obeying the simple instinct of wrath and
vengeance, threw away this great political advantage, which the more
long-sighted Periklês would gladly have turned to account.</p>

<p>At the time when the Athenians sent their herald to Platæa,
they also issued orders for seizing all Bœotians who might be
found in Attica; while they lost no time in sending forces to
provision Platæa, and placing it on the footing of a garrison<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[p. 120]</span> town, removing to
Athens the old men and sick, with the women and children. No
complaint or discussion, respecting the recent surprise, was
thought of by either party: it was evident to both that the war
was now actually begun,—that nothing was to be thought of except
the means of carrying it on,—and that there could be no farther
personal intercourse except under the protection of heralds.<a
id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a>
The incident at Platæa, striking in all its points, wound up both
parties to the full pitch of warlike excitement. A spirit of
resolution and enterprise was abroad everywhere, especially among
those younger citizens, yet unacquainted with the actual bitterness
of war, whom the long truce but just broken had raised up; and the
contagion of high-strung feeling spread from the leading combatants
into every corner of Greece, manifesting itself partly in multiplied
oracles, prophecies, and religious legends adapted to the moment:<a
id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a>
a recent earthquake at Delos, too, as well as various other
extraordinary physical phenomena, were construed as prognostics of
the awful struggle impending,—a period fatally marked not less by
eclipses, earthquakes, drought, famine, and pestilence, than by the
direct calamities of war.<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210"
class="fnanchor">[210]</a></p>

<p>An aggression so unwarrantable as the assault on Platæa tended
doubtless to strengthen the unanimity of the Athenian assembly, to
silence the opponents of Periklês, and to lend additional weight to
those frequent exhortations,<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211"
class="fnanchor">[211]</a> whereby the great statesman was wont to
sustain the courage of his countrymen. Intelligence was sent round
to forewarn and hearten up the numerous allies of Athens, tributary
as well as free: the latter, with the exception of the Thessalians,
Akarnanians, and Messenians at Naupaktus, were all insular,—Chians,
Lesbians, Korkyræans, and Zakynthians: to the island of Kephallênia
also they sent envoys, but it was not actually acquired to their
alliance until a few months afterwards.<a id="FNanchor_212"
href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> With the Akarnanians,
too, their connection had only been commenced a short time before,
seem<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[p. 121]</span>ingly during
the preceding summer, arising out of the circumstances of the
town of Argos in Amphilochia. That town, situated on the southern
coast of the Ambrakian gulf, was originally occupied by a portion
of the Amphilochi, a non-Hellenic tribe, whose lineage apparently
was something intermediate between Akarnanians and Epirots. Some
colonists from Ambrakia, having been admitted as co-residents with
the Amphilochian inhabitants of this town, presently expelled them,
and retained the town with its territory exclusively for themselves.
The expelled inhabitants, fraternizing with their fellow tribes
around as well as with the Akarnanians, looked out for the means
of restoration; and in order to obtain it, invited the assistance
of Athens. Accordingly, the Athenians sent an expedition of thirty
triremes, under Phormio, who, joining the Amphilochians and
Akarnanians, attacked and carried Argos, reduced the Ambrakiots to
slavery, and restored the town to the Amphilochians and Akarnanians.
It was on this occasion that the alliance of the Akarnanians with
Athens was first concluded, and that their personal attachment
to the Athenian admiral, Phormio, commenced.<a id="FNanchor_213"
href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></p>

<p>The numerous subjects of Athens, whose contributions stood
embodied in the annual tribute, were distributed all over and
around the Ægean, including all the islands north of Krete,
with the exception of Melos and Thera.<a id="FNanchor_214"
href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> Moreover, the
elements of force collected in Athens itself, were fully worthy
of the metropolis of so great an empire. Periklês could make a
report to his countrymen of three hundred triremes fit for active
service; twelve hundred horsemen and horse-bowmen; sixteen hundred
bowmen; and the great force of all, not less than twenty-nine
thousand hoplites,—mostly citizens, but in part also metics.<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[p. 122]</span> The chosen portion of
these hoplites, both as to age and as to equipment, were thirteen
thousand in number; while the remaining sixteen thousand, including
the elder and younger citizens and the metics, did garrison-duty
on the walls of Athens and Peiræus,—on the long line of wall which
connected Athens both with Peiræus and Phalêrum,—and in the various
fortified posts both in and out of Attica. In addition to these large
military and naval forces, the city possessed in the acropolis, an
accumulated treasure of coined silver amounting to not less than
six thousand talents, or about one million four hundred thousand
pounds, derived from annual laying by of tribute from the allies
and perhaps of other revenues besides: the treasure had at one time
been as large as nine thousand seven hundred talents, or about two
million two hundred and thirty thousand pounds, but the cost of the
recent religious and architectural decorations at Athens, as well as
at the siege of Potidæa, had reduced it to six thousand. Moreover,
the acropolis and the temples throughout the city were rich in
votive offerings, deposits, sacred plate, and silver implements for
the processions and festivals, etc., to an amount estimated at more
than five hundred talents; while the great statue of the goddess
recently set up by Pheidias in the Parthenon, composed of ivory and
gold, included a quantity of the latter metal not less than forty
talents in weight,—equal in value to more than four hundred talents
of silver,—and all of it go arranged that it could be taken off from
the statue at pleasure. In alluding to these sacred valuables among
the resources of the state, Periklês spoke of them only as open to
be so applied in case of need, with the firm resolution of replacing
them during the first season of prosperity, just as the Corinthians
had proposed to borrow from Delphi and Olympia. Besides the hoard
thus actually in hand, there came in a large annual revenue,
amounting, under the single head of tribute from the subject allies,
to six hundred talents, equal to about one hundred and thirty-eight
thousand pounds; besides all other items,<a id="FNanchor_215"
href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> making up a general
total of at least one thousand talents, or about two hundred and
thirty thousand pounds.</p>

<p>To this formidable catalogue of means for war were to be<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[p. 123]</span> added other items
not less important, but which did not admit of being weighed and
numbered; the unrivalled maritime skill and discipline of the
seamen,—the democratical sentiment, alike fervent and unanimous,
of the general mass of citizens,—and the superior development
of directing intelligence. And when we consider that the enemy
had indeed on his side an irresistible land-force, but scarcely
anything else,—few ships, no trained seamen, no funds, no powers
of combination or headship,—we may be satisfied that there were
ample materials for an orator like Periklês to draw an encouraging
picture of the future. He could depict Athens as holding Peloponnesus
under siege by means of her navy and a chain of insular posts;<a
id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> and
he could guarantee success<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217"
class="fnanchor">[217]</a> as the sure reward of persevering,
orderly, and well-considered exertion, combined with firm endurance
under a period of temporary but unavoidable suffering; and combined
too with another condition hardly less difficult for Athenian temper
to comply with,—abstinence from seductive speculations of distant
enterprise, while their force was required by the necessities
of war near home.<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218"
class="fnanchor">[218]</a> But such prospects were founded upon
a long-sighted calculation, looking beyond immediate loss, and
therefore likely to take less hold of the mind of an ordinary
citizen,—or at any rate, to be overwhelmed for the moment by the
pressure of actual hardship. Moreover, the best which Periklês could
promise was a successful resistance,—the unimpaired maintenance of
that great empire to which Athens had become accustomed; a policy
purely conservative, without any stimulus from the hope of positive
acquisition,—and not only without the sympathy of other states, but
with feelings of simple acquiescence on the part of most of her
allies,—of strong hostility everywhere else.</p>

<p>On all these latter points the position of the Peloponnesian
alliance was far more encouraging. So powerful a body of con<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[p. 124]</span>federates had never
been got together,—not even to resist Xerxes. Not only the entire
strength of Peloponnesus—except Argeians and Achæans, both of whom
were neutral at first, though the Achæan town of Pellênê joined
even at the beginning, and all the rest subsequently—was brought
together, but also the Megarians, Bœotians, Phocians, Opuntian
Lokrians, Ambrakiots, Leukadians, and Anaktorians. Among these,
Corinth, Megara, Sikyon, Pellênê, Elis, Ambrakia, and Leukas,
furnished maritime force, while the Bœotians, Phocians, and Lokrians
supplied cavalry. Many of these cities, however, supplied hoplites
besides; but the remainder of the confederates furnished hoplites
only. It was upon this latter force, not omitting the powerful
Bœotian cavalry, that the main reliance was placed; especially for
the first and most important operation of the war,—the devastation
of Attica. Bound together by the strongest common feeling of active
antipathy to Athens, the whole confederacy was full of hope and
confidence for this immediate forward march,—so gratifying at once
both to their hatred and to their love of plunder, by the hand of
destruction laid upon the richest country in Greece,—and presenting
a chance even of terminating the war at once, if the pride of the
Athenians should be so intolerably stung as to provoke them to come
out and fight. Certainty of immediate success, at the first outset, a
common purpose to be accomplished and a common enemy to be put down,
and favorable sympathies throughout Greece,—all these circumstances
filled the Peloponnesians with sanguine hopes at the beginning of
the war: and the general persuasion was, that Athens, even if not
reduced to submission by the first invasion, could not possibly
hold out more than two or three summers against the repetition of
this destructive process.<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219"
class="fnanchor">[219]</a> Strongly did this confidence contrast
with the proud and resolute submission to necessity, not without
desponding anticipations of the result, which reigned among the
auditors of Periklês.<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220"
class="fnanchor">[220]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[p. 125]</span></p>

<p>But though the Peloponnesians entertained confident belief of
carrying their point by simple land-campaign, they did not neglect
auxiliary preparations for naval and prolonged war. The Lacedæmonians
resolved to make up the naval force already existing among themselves
and their allies to an aggregate of five hundred triremes; chiefly
by the aid of the friendly Dorian cities on the Italian and Sicilian
coast. Upon each of them a specific contribution was imposed,
together with a given contingent; orders being transmitted to them
to make such preparations silently without any immediate declaration
of hostility against Athens, and even without refusing for the
present to admit any single Athenian ship into their harbors.<a
id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a>
Besides this, the Lacedæmonians laid their schemes for sending envoys
to the Persian king, and to other barbaric powers,—a remarkable
evidence of melancholy revolution in Grecian affairs, when that
potentate, whom the common arm of Greece had so hardly repulsed a few
years before, was now invoked to bring the Phenician fleet again into
the Ægean for the purpose of crushing Athens.</p>

<p>The invasion of Attica, however, without delay, was the primary
object to be accomplished; and for that the Lacedæmonians issued
circular orders immediately after the attempted surprise at Platæa.
Though the vote of the allies was requisite to sanction any war, yet
when that vote had once been passed, the Lacedæmonians took upon
themselves to direct all the measures of execution. Two-thirds of the
hoplites of each confederate city,—apparently two-thirds of a certain
assumed rating, for which the city was held liable in the books
of the confederacy, so that the Bœotians and others who furnished
cavalry were not constrained to send two-thirds of their entire force
of hoplites,—were summoned to be present on a certain day at the
isthmus of Corinth, with provisions and equipment for an expedition
of some length.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[p. 126]</span><a
id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a>
On the day named, the entire force was found duly assembled, and
the Spartan king Archidamus, on taking the command, addressed to
the commanders and principal officers from each city a discourse of
solemn warning as well as encouragement. His remarks were directed
chiefly to abate the tone of sanguine over-confidence which reigned
in the army. After adverting to the magnitude of the occasion, the
mighty impulse agitating all Greece, and the general good wishes
which accompanied them against an enemy so much hated,—he admonished
them not to let their great superiority of numbers and bravery seduce
them into a spirit of rash disorder. “We are about to attack (he
said) an enemy admirably equipped in every way, so that we may be
very certain that they will come out and fight,<a id="FNanchor_223"
href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> even if they be
not now actually on the march to meet us at the border, at least
when they see us in their territory ravaging and destroying their
property. All men exposed to any unusual indignity become incensed,
and act more under passion than under calculation, when it is
actually brought under their eyes: much more will the Athenians do
so, accustomed as they are to empire, and to ravage the territory of
others rather than to see their own so treated.”</p>

<p>Immediately on the army being assembled, Archidamus sent
Melêsippus as envoy to Athens to announce the coming invasion, being
still in hopes that the Athenians would yield. But a resolution had
been already adopted, at the instance of Periklês, to receive neither
herald nor envoy from the Lacedæmonians when once their army was
on its march: so that Melêsippus was sent back without even being
permitted to enter the city. He was ordered to quit the territory
before sunset, with guides to accompany him and prevent him from
addressing a word to any one. On parting from his guides at the
border, Melêsippus exclaimed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[p.
127]</span><a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224"
class="fnanchor">[224]</a> with a solemnity but too accurately
justified by the event: “This day will be the beginning of many
calamities to the Greeks.”</p>

<p>Archidamus, as soon as the reception of his last envoy was made
known to him, continued his march from the isthmus into Attica,—which
territory he entered by the road of Œnoê, the frontier Athenian
fortress of Attica towards Bœotia. His march was slow, and he thought
it necessary to make a regular attack on the fort of Œnoê, which had
been put into so good a state of defence, that after all the various
modes of assault, in which the Lacedæmonians were not skilful,
had been tried in vain,<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225"
class="fnanchor">[225]</a>—and after a delay of several days before
the place,—he was compelled to renounce the attempt.</p>

<p>The want of enthusiasm on the part of the Spartan king,—his
multiplied delays, first at the isthmus, next in the march,
and lastly before Œnoê,—were all offensive to the fiery
impatience of the army, who were loud in their murmurs against
him. He acted upon the calculation already laid down in his
discourse at Sparta,<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226"
class="fnanchor">[226]</a>—that the highly cultivated soil of Attica
was to be looked upon as a hostage for the pacific dispositions of
the Athenians, who would be more likely to yield when devastation,
though not yet inflicted, was nevertheless impending, and at their
doors. In this point of view, a little delay at the border was no
disadvantage; and perhaps the partisans of peace at Athens may have
encouraged him to hope that it would enable them to prevail. Nor
can we doubt that it was a moment full of difficulty to Periklês
at Athens. He had to proclaim to all the proprietors in Attica the
painful truth, that they must prepare to see their lands and houses
overrun and ruined; and that their persons, families, and movable
property, must be brought in for safety either to Athens, or to
one of the forts in the territory,—or carried across to one of the
neighboring islands. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[p.
128]</span> would, indeed, make a favorable impression when he told
them that Archidamus was his own family friend, yet only within
such limits as consisted with duty to the city: in case, therefore,
the invaders, while ravaging Attica, should receive instruction
to spare his own lands, he would forthwith make them over to the
state as public property: nor was such a case unlikely to arise,
if not from the personal feeling of Archidamus, at least from the
deliberate manœuvre of the Spartans, who would seek thus to set the
Athenian public against Periklês, as they had tried to do before
by demanding the banishment of the sacrilegious Alkmæônid race.<a
id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a>
But though this declaration would doubtless provoke a hearty cheer,
the lesson which he had to inculcate, not simply for admission as
prudent policy, but for actual practice, was one revolting alike
to the immediate interest, the dignity, and the sympathies of his
countrymen. To see their lands all ravaged, without raising an arm to
defend them,—to carry away their wives and families, and to desert
and dismantle their country residences, as they had done during the
Persian invasion,—all in the confidence of compensation in other ways
and of remote ultimate success,—were recommendations which, probably,
no one but Periklês could have hoped to enforce. They were, moreover,
the more painful to execute, inasmuch as the Athenian citizens had
very generally retained the habits of residing permanently, not in
Athens, but in the various demes of Attica; many of which still
preserved their temples, their festivals, their local customs,
and their limited municipal autonomy, handed down from the day
when they had once been independent of Athens.<a id="FNanchor_228"
href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> It was but recently
that the farming, the comforts, and the ornaments, thus distributed
over Attica, had been restored from the ruin of the Persian invasion,
and brought to a higher pitch of improvement than ever; yet the
fruits of this labor, and the scenes of these local affections,
were now to be again delib<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[p.
129]</span>erately abandoned to a new aggressor, and exchanged for
the utmost privation and discomfort. Archidamus might well doubt
whether the Athenians would nerve themselves up to the pitch of
resolution necessary for this distressing step, when it came to the
actual crisis; and whether they would not constrain Periklês against
his will to make propositions for peace. His delay on the border, and
postponement of actual devastation, gave the best chance for such
propositions being made; though as this calculation was not realized,
the army raised plausible complaints against him for having allowed
the Athenians time to save so much of their property.</p>

<p>From all parts of Attica the residents flocked within the
spacious walls of Athens, which now served as shelter for the
houseless, like Salamis, forty-nine years before: entire families
with all their movable property, and even with the woodwork of
their houses; the sheep and cattle were conveyed to Eubœa and the
other adjoining islands.<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229"
class="fnanchor">[229]</a> Though a few among the fugitives obtained
dwellings or reception from friends, the greater number were
compelled to encamp in the vacant spaces of the city and Peiræus, or
in and around the numerous temples of the city,—always excepting the
acropolis and the eleusinion, which were at all times strictly closed
to profane occupants; but even the ground called <i>the Pelasgikon</i>,
immediately under the acropolis, which, by an ancient and ominous
tradition, was interdicted to human abode,<a id="FNanchor_230"
href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> was made use of
under the present necessity. Many, too, placed their families in
the towers and recesses of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[p.
130]</span> the city walls,<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231"
class="fnanchor">[231]</a> or in sheds, cabins, tents, or even tubs,
disposed along the course of the long walls to Peiræus. In spite of
so serious an accumulation of losses and hardships, the glorious
endurance of their fathers in the time of Xerxes was faithfully
copied, and copied too under more honorable circumstances, since at
that time there had been no option possible; whereas, the march of
Archidamus might, perhaps, now have been arrested by submissions,
ruinous indeed to Athenian dignity, yet not inconsistent with the
security of Athens, divested of her rank and power. Such submissions,
if suggested as they probably may have been by the party opposed to
Periklês, found no echo among the suffering population.</p>

<p>After having spent several days before Œnoê without either taking
the fort or receiving any message from the Athenians, Archidamus
marched onward to Eleusis and the Thriasian plain,—about the middle
of June, eighty days after the surprise of Platæa. His army was
of irresistible force, not less than sixty thousand hoplites,
according to the statement of Plutarch,<a id="FNanchor_232"
href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> or of one hundred
thousand, according to others: considering the number of constituent
allies, the strong feeling by which they were prompted, and the
shortness of the expedition combined with the chance of plunder,
even the largest of these two numbers is not incredibly great, if we
take it to include not hoplites only, but cavalry and light-armed
also: but as Thucydidês, though comparatively full in his account
of this march, has stated no general total, we may presume that he
had heard none upon which he could rely. As the Athenians had made
no movement towards peace, Archidamus anticipated that they would
come forth to meet him in the fertile plain of Eleusis and Thria,
which was the first portion of territory that he sat down to ravage:
but no Athenian force appeared to oppose him, except a detachment
of cavalry, who were repulsed in a skirmish near the small lakes
called Rheiti. Having laid waste this plain without any serious
opposition, Archidamus did not think fit to<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_131">[p. 131]</span> pursue the straight road which from
Thria conducted directly to Athens across the ridge of Mount
Ægaleos, but turned off to the westward, leaving that mountain on
his right hand until he came to Krôpeia, where he crossed a portion
of the line of Ægaleos over to Acharnæ. He was here about seven
miles from Athens, on a declivity sloping down into the plain which
stretches westerly and northwesterly from Athens, and visible from
the city walls: and he here encamped, keeping his army in perfect
order for battle, but at the same time intending to damage and
ruin the place and its neighborhood. Acharnæ was the largest and
most populous of all the demes in Attica, furnishing no less than
three thousand hoplites to the national line, and flourishing as
well by its corn, vines, and olives, as by its peculiar abundance
of charcoal-burning from the forests of ilex on the neighboring
hills: moreover, if we are to believe Aristophanês, the Acharnian
proprietors were not merely sturdy “hearts of oak,” but peculiarly
vehement and irritable.<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233"
class="fnanchor">[233]</a> It illustrates the condition of a Grecian
territory under invasion, when we find this great deme, which could
not have contained less than twelve thousand free inhabitants of
both sexes and all ages, with at least an equal number of slaves,
completely deserted. Archidamus calculated that when the Athenians
actually saw his troops so close to their city, carrying fire and
sword over their wealthiest canton, their indignation would become
uncontrollable, and they would march out forthwith to battle. The
Acharnian proprietors especially, he thought, would be foremost in
inflaming this temper, and insisting upon protection to their own
properties,—or, if the remaining citizens refused to march out along
with them, they would, after having been thus left undefended to
ruin, become discontented and indifferent to the general weal.<a
id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a></p>

<p>Though his calculation was not realized, it was, nevertheless,
founded upon most rational grounds. What Archidamus antic<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[p. 132]</span>ipated was on the
point of happening, and nothing prevented it, except the personal
ascendency of Periklês, strained to its very utmost. So long as the
invading army was engaged in the Thriasian plain, the Athenians
had some faint hope that it might—like Pleistoanax, fourteen years
before—advance no farther into the interior: but when it came to
Acharnæ, within sight of the city walls,—when the ravagers were
actually seen destroying buildings, fruit-trees, and crops, in
the plain of Athens, a sight strange to every Athenian eye except
to those very old men who recollected the Persian invasion,—the
exasperation of the general body of citizens rose to a pitch never
before known. The Acharnians first of all, next the youthful
citizens generally,—became madly clamorous for arming and going
forth to fight. Knowing well their own great strength, but less
correctly informed of the superior strength of the enemy, they
felt confident that victory was within their reach. Groups of
citizens were everywhere gathered together,<a id="FNanchor_235"
href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> angrily debating the
critical question of the moment; while the usual concomitants of
excited feeling,—oracles and prophecies of diverse tenor, many of
them, doubtless, promising success against the enemy at Acharnæ,—were
eagerly caught up and circulated.</p>

<p>In this inflamed temper of the Athenian mind, Periklês was
naturally the great object of complaint and wrath. He was denounced
as the cause of all the existing suffering: he was reviled as a
coward for not leading out the citizens to fight, in his capacity
of general: the rational convictions as to the necessity of the
war and the only practicable means of carrying it on, which his
repeated speeches had implanted, seemed to be altogether forgotten.<a
id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a>
This burst of spontaneous discontent was, of course, fomented by the
numerous political enemies of Periklês, and particularly by Kleon,<a
id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> now
rising into importance as an opposition-speaker; whose talent for
invective was thus first exercised under the auspices of the high
aristocratical party, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[p.
133]</span> well as of an excited public. But no manifestations,
however violent, could disturb either the judgment or the firmness
of Periklês. He listened, unmoved, to all the declarations made
against him, and resolutely refused to convene any public assembly,
or any meeting invested with an authorized character, under the
present irritated temper of the citizens.<a id="FNanchor_238"
href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> It appears that he,
as general, or rather the board of ten generals, among whom he was
one, must have been invested constitutionally with the power, not
only of calling the ekklesia when they thought fit, but also of
preventing it from meeting,<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239"
class="fnanchor">[239]</a> and of postponing even those regular
meetings which commonly took place at fixed times, four times in
the prytany. No assembly, accordingly, took place, and the violent
exasperation of the people was thus prevented from realizing itself
in any rash public resolution. That Periklês should have held firm
against this raging force, is but one among the many honorable
points in his political character; but it is far less wonderful than
the fact, that his refusal to call the ekklesia was efficacious to
prevent the ekklesia from being held. The entire body of Athenians
were now assembled within the walls, and if he refused to convoke
the ekklesia, they might easily have met in the Pnyx, without him;
for which it would not have been difficult at such a juncture to
provide plausible justification. The inviolable respect which
the Athenian people manifested on this occasion for the forms
of their democratical constitution—assisted doubtless by their
long-established esteem for Periklês, yet opposed to an excitement
alike intense and pervading, and to a demand apparently reasonable,
in so far as regarded the calling of an assembly for discussion,—is
one of the most memorable incidents in their history.</p>

<p>While Periklês thus decidedly forbade any general march out for
battle, he sought to provide as much employment as possible for
the compressed eagerness of the citizens. The cavalry were<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[p. 134]</span> sent out, together with
the Thessalian cavalry their allies, for the purpose of restraining
the excursions of the enemy’s light troops, and protecting the lands
near the city from plunder.<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240"
class="fnanchor">[240]</a> At the same time, he fitted out a powerful
expedition, which sailed forth to ravage Peloponnesus, even while the
invaders were yet in Attica.<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241"
class="fnanchor">[241]</a> Archidamus, after having remained engaged
in the devastation of Acharnæ long enough to satisfy himself that
the Athenians would not hazard a battle, turned away from Athens
in a northwesterly direction towards the demes between Mount
Brilêssus and Mount Parnês, on the road passing through Dekeleia.
The army continued ravaging these districts until their provisions
were exhausted, and then quitted Attica by the northwestern road
near Orôpus, which brought them into Bœotia. The Oropians were
not Athenians, but dependent upon Athens, and the district of
Græa, a portion of their territory, was laid waste; after which,
the army dispersed and retired back to their respective homes.<a
id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> It
would seem that they quitted Attica towards the end of July, having
remained in the country between thirty and forty days.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Athenian expedition under Karkinus, Prôteas,
and Sokratês, joined by fifty Korkyræan ships, and by some other
allies, sailed round Peloponnesus, landing in various parts to
inflict damage, and among other places, at Methônê (Modon) on
the southwestern peninsula of the Lacedæmonian territory.<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[p. 135]</span><a id="FNanchor_243"
href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> The place, neither
strong nor well-garrisoned, would have been carried with little
difficulty, had not Brasidas the son of Tellis,—a gallant Spartan
now mentioned for the first time, but destined to great celebrity
afterwards,—who happened to be on guard at a neighboring post,
thrown himself into it with one hundred men by a rapid movement,
before the dispersed Athenian troops could be brought together to
prevent him. He infused such courage into the defenders of the place
that every attack was repelled, and the Athenians were forced to
reëmbark,—an act of prowess which procured for him the first public
honors bestowed by the Spartans during this war. Sailing northward
along the western coast of Peloponnesus, the Athenians landed again
on the coast of Elis, a little south of the promontory called Cape
Ichthys: they ravaged the territory for two days, defeating both
the troops in the neighborhood and three hundred chosen men from
the central Eleian territory. Strong winds on a harborless coast
now induced the captains to sail with most of the troops round Cape
Ichthys, in order to reach the harbor of Pheia on the northern side
of it; while the Messenian hoplites, marching by land across the
promontory, attacked Pheia and carried it by assault. When the fleet
arrived, all were reëmbarked,—the full force of Elis being under
march to attack them: they then sailed northward, landing on various
other spots to commit devastation, until they reached Sollium, a
Corinthian settlement on the coast of Akarnania. They captured this
place, which they handed over to the inhabitants of the neighboring
Akarnanian town of Palærus,—as well as Astakus, from whence they
expelled the despot Euarchus, and enrolled the town as a member of
the Athenian alliance. From hence they passed over to Kephallênia,
which they were fortunate enough also to acquire as an ally of Athens
without any compulsion,—with its four distinct towns, or districts,
Palês, Kranii, Samê, and Pionê. These various operations took up near
three months from about the beginning of July, so that they returned
to Athens towards the close of September,<a id="FNanchor_244"
href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a>—the beginning of
the winter half of the year, according to the distribution of
Thucydidês.</p>

<p>Nor was this the only maritime expedition of the summer:<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[p. 136]</span> thirty more triremes,
under Kleopompus, were sent through the Euripus to the Lokrian coast
opposite to the northern part of Eubœa. Some disembarkations were
made, whereby the Lokrian towns of Thronium and Alopê were sacked,
and farther devastation inflicted: while a permanent garrison
was planted, and a fortified post erected, in the uninhabited
island of Atalanta, opposite to the Lokrian coast, in order to
restrain privateers from Opus and the other Lokrian towns in their
excursions against Eubœa.<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245"
class="fnanchor">[245]</a> It was farther determined to expel
the Æginetan inhabitants from Ægina, and to occupy the island
with Athenian colonists. This step was partly rendered prudent by
the important position of the island midway between Attica and
Peloponnesus; but a concurrent motive, and probably the stronger
motive, was the gratification of ancient antipathy and revenge
against a people who had been among the foremost in provoking the
war and in inflicting upon Athens so much suffering. The Æginetans
with their wives and children were all put on shipboard and landed
in Peloponnesus,—where the Spartans permitted them to occupy the
maritime district and town of Thyrea, their last frontier towards
Argos: some of them, however, found shelter in other parts of Greece.
The island was made over to a detachment of Athenian kleruchs,
or citizen proprietors, sent thither by lot.<a id="FNanchor_246"
href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a></p>

<p>To the sufferings of the Æginetans, which we shall hereafter
find still more deplorably aggravated, we have to add those of the
Megarians. Both had been most zealous in kindling the war, but upon
none did the distress of war fall so heavily. Both probably shared
the premature confidence felt among the Peloponnesian confederacy,
that Athens could never hold out more than a year or two,—and were
thus induced to overlook their own undefended position against her.
Towards the close of September, the full force of Athens, citizens
and metics, marched into the Megarid under Periklês, and laid waste
the greater part of the territory: while they were in it, the hundred
ships which had been circumnavigating Peloponnesus, having arrived at
Ægina on their return, went and joined their fellow-citizens in<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[p. 137]</span> the Megarid, instead
of going straight home. The junction of the two formed the largest
Athenian force that had ever yet been seen together: there were ten
thousand citizen hoplites, independent of three thousand others
who were engaged in the siege of Potidæa, and three thousand metic
hoplites,—besides a large number of light troops.<a id="FNanchor_247"
href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> Against so large a
force the Megarians could of course make no head, and their territory
was all laid waste, even to the city walls. For several years of the
war, the Athenians inflicted this destruction once, and often twice
in the same year: a decree was proposed in the Athenian ekklesia by
Charinus, though perhaps not carried, to the effect that the stratêgi
every year should swear, as a portion of their oath of office,<a
id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a>
that they would twice invade and ravage the Megarid. As the Athenians
at the same time kept the port of Nisæa blocked up, by means of their
superior naval force and of the neighboring coast of Salamis, the
privations imposed on the Megarians became extreme and intolerable.<a
id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a>
Not merely their corn and fruits, but even their garden vegetables
near the city, were rooted up and destroyed, and their situation
seems often to have been that of a besieged city hard pressed by
famine. Even in the time of Pausanias, so many centuries afterwards,
the miseries of the town during these years were remembered and
communicated to him, being assigned as the reason why one of their
most memorable statues had never been completed.<a id="FNanchor_250"
href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a></p>

<p>To these various military operations of Athens during the
course of this summer, some other measures of moment are to be
added; and Thucydidês also notices an eclipse of the sun which
modern astronomical calculations refer to the third of August: had
this eclipse happened three months earlier, immediately before
the entrance of the Peloponnesians into Attica, it might<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[p. 138]</span> probably have been
construed as an unfavorable omen, and caused the postponement of
the scheme. Expecting a prolonged struggle, the Athenians now made
arrangements for placing Attica in a permanent state of defence,
both by sea and land; what these arrangements were, we are not told
in detail, but one of them was sufficiently remarkable to be named
particularly. They set apart one thousand talents out of the treasure
in the acropolis as an inviolable reserve, not to be touched except
on the single contingency of a hostile naval force about to assail
the city, with no other means at hand to defend it. They further
enacted, that if any citizen should propose, or any magistrate
put the question, in the public assembly, to make any different
application of this reserve, he should be punishable with death.
Moreover, they resolved every year to keep back one hundred of their
best triremes, and trierarchs to command and equip them, for the
same special necessity.<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251"
class="fnanchor">[251]</a> It may be doubted whether this latter
provision was placed under the same stringent sanction, or observed
with the same rigor, as that concerning the money, which latter was
not departed from until the twentieth year of the war, after all the
disasters of the Sicilian expedition, and on the terrible news of the
revolt of Chios. It was on that occasion that the Athenians first
repealed the sentence of capital punishment against the proposer
of this forbidden change, and next appropriated the money to meet
the then imminent peril of the commonwealth.<a id="FNanchor_252"
href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a></p>

<p>The resolution here taken about this sacred reserve, and the
rigorous sentence interdicting contrary propositions, is pronounced
by Mr. Mitford to be an evidence of the indelible barbarism of
democratical government.<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253"
class="fnanchor">[253]</a> But we must recollect, first, that
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[p. 139]</span> sentence
of capital punishment was one which could hardly by possibility
come into execution; for no citizen would be so mad as to make
the forbidden proposition, while this law was in force. Whoever
desired to make it, would first begin by proposing to repeal
the prohibitory law, whereby he would incur no danger, whether
the assembly decided in the affirmative or negative; and if he
obtained an affirmative decision, he would then, and then only,
proceed to move the reappropriation of the fund. To speak the
language of English parliamentary procedure, he would first move
the suspension or abrogation of the standing order whereby the
proposition was forbidden,—next, he would move the proposition
itself: in fact, such was the mode actually pursued, when the thing
at last came to be done.<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254"
class="fnanchor">[254]</a> But though the capital sentence could
hardly come into effect, the proclamation of it <i>in terrorem</i>
had a very distinct meaning. It expressed the deep and solemn
conviction which the people entertained of the importance of their
own resolution about the reserve,—it forewarned all assemblies and
all citizens to come, of the danger of diverting it to any other
purpose,—it surrounded the reserve with an artificial sanctity,
which forced every man who aimed at the reappropriation to begin
with a preliminary proposition, formidable on the very face of it,
as removing a guarantee which previous assemblies had deemed of
immense value, and opening the door to a contingency which they
had looked upon as treasonable. The proclamation of a lighter
punishment, or a simple prohibition without any definite sanction
whatever, would neither have announced the same emphatic conviction,
nor produced the same deterring effect. The assembly of 431 <small>B.C.</small> could not in any way enact laws which
subsequent assemblies could not reverse; but it could so frame
its enactments, in cases of peculiar solemnity, as to make its
authority strongly felt upon the judgment of its successors, and
to prevent them from entertaining motions for repeal, except under
necessity at once urgent and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[p.
140]</span> obvious. Far from thinking that the law now passed at
Athens displayed barbarism, either in the end or in the means, I
consider it principally remarkable for its cautious and long-sighted
view of the future,—qualities the exact reverse of barbarism,—and
worthy of the general character of Periklês, who probably suggested
it. Athens was just entering into a war which threatened to be of
indefinite length, and was certain to be very costly. To prevent
the people from exhausting all their accumulated fund, and to place
them under a necessity of reserving something against extreme
casualties, was an object of immense importance. Now the particular
casualty, which Periklês, assuming him to be the proposer, named as
the sole condition of touching this one thousand talents, might be
considered as of all others the most improbable, in the year 431
<small>B.C.</small> So immense was then the superiority
of the Athenian naval force, that to suppose it defeated, and a
Peloponnesian fleet in full sail for Peiræus, was a possibility which
it required a statesman of extraordinary caution to look forward
to, and which it is truly wonderful that the people generally could
have been induced to contemplate. Once tied up to this purpose,
however, the fund lay ready for any other terrible emergency: and
we shall find the actual employment of it incalculably beneficial
to Athens, at a moment of the gravest peril, when she could hardly
have protected herself without some such special resource. The people
would scarcely have sanctioned so rigorous an economy, had it not
been proposed to them at a period so early in the war that their
available reserve was still much larger: but it will be forever to
the credit of their foresight as well as constancy, that they should
first have adopted such a precautionary measure, and afterwards
adhered to it for nineteen years, under severe pressure for money,
until at length a case arose which rendered farther abstinence
really, and not constructively, impossible.</p>

<p>To display their force and take revenge by disembarking and
ravaging parts of Peloponnesus, was doubtless of much importance
to Athens during this first summer of the war: though it might
seem that the force so employed was quite as much needed in the
conquest of Potidæa, which still remained under blockade,—and of the
neighboring Chalkidians in Thrace, still in revolt. It was during the
course of this summer that a prospect opened<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_141">[p. 141]</span> to Athens of subduing these towns,
through the assistance of Sitalkês, king of the Odrysian Thracians.
That prince had married the sister of Nymphodôrus, a citizen of
Abdêra; who engaged to render him, and his son Sadokus, allies of
Athens. Sent for to Athens and appointed proxenus of Athens at
Abdêra, which was one of the Athenian subject allies, Nymphodôrus
made this alliance, and promised, in the name of Sitalkês, that
a sufficient Thracian force should be sent to aid Athens in the
reconquest of her revolted towns: the honor of Athenian citizenship
was at the same time conferred upon Sadokus.<a id="FNanchor_255"
href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> Nymphodôrus farther
established a good understanding between Perdikkas of Macedonia
and the Athenians, who were persuaded to restore to him Therma,
which they had before taken from him. The Athenians had thus the
promise of powerful aid against the Chalkidians and Potidæans:
yet the latter still held out, with little prospect of immediate
surrender. Moreover, the town of Astakus, in Akarnania, which the
Athenians had captured during the summer, in the course of their
expedition round Peloponnesus, was recovered during the autumn by
the deposed despot Euarchus, assisted by forty Corinthian triremes
and one thousand hoplites. This Corinthian armament, after restoring
Euarchus, made some unsuccessful descents both upon other parts
of Akarnania and upon the island of Kephallênia: in the latter,
they were entrapped into an ambuscade, and obliged to return home
with considerable loss.<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256"
class="fnanchor">[256]</a></p>

<p>It was towards the close of this autumn also that Periklês,
chosen by the people for the purpose, delivered the funeral oration
at the public interment of those warriors who had fallen during the
campaign. The ceremonies of this public token of respect have already
been described in a former chapter, on occasion of the conquest of
Samos: but that which imparted to the present scene an imperishable
interest, was the discourse of the chosen statesman and orator;
probably heard by Thucydidês himself, and in substance reproduced. A
large crowd of citizens and foreigners, of both sexes and all ages,
accompanied the funeral procession from Athens to the suburb called
the outer Kerameikus, where Periklês, mounted upon a lofty stage
pre<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[p. 142]</span>pared for the
occasion, closed the ceremony with his address. The law of Athens
not only provided this public funeral and commemorative discourse,
but also assigned maintenance at the public expense to the children
of the slain warriors until they attained military age: a practice
which was acted on throughout the whole war, though we have only
the description and discourse belonging to this single occasion.<a
id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a></p>

<p>The eleven chapters of Thucydidês which comprise this funeral
speech are among the most memorable relics of antiquity; considering
that under the language and arrangement of the historian,—always
impressive, though sometimes harsh and peculiar, like the workmanship
of a powerful mind, misled by a bad or an unattainable model,—we
possess the substance and thoughts of the illustrious statesman. A
portion of it, of course, is and must be common-place, belonging to
all discourses composed for a similar occasion. Yet this is true
only of a comparatively small portion: much of it is peculiar, and
every way worthy of Periklês,—comprehensive, rational, and full,
not less of sense and substance than of earnest patriotism. It thus
forms a strong contrast with the jejune, though elegant, rhetoric
of other harangues, mostly<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258"
class="fnanchor">[258]</a> not composed for actual delivery;
and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[p. 143]</span> deserves,
in comparison with the funeral discourses remaining to us from
Plato, and the Pseudo-Demosthenês, and even Lysias, the honorable
distinction which Thucydidês claims for his own history,—an
ever-living possession, and not a mere show-piece for the moment.</p>

<p>In the outset of his speech, Periklês distinguishes himself from
those who had preceded him in the same function of public orator,
by dissenting from the encomiums which it had been customary to
bestow on the law enjoining these funeral harangues: he thinks that
the publicity of the funeral itself, and the general demonstrations
of respect and grief by the great body of citizens, tell more
emphatically in token of gratitude to the brave dead, when the
scene passes in silence, than when it is translated into the words
of a speaker, who may easily offend, either by incompetency or by
apparent feebleness, or perhaps even by unseasonable exaggeration.
Nevertheless, the custom having been embodied in law, and elected
as he has been by the citizens, he comes forward to discharge the
duty imposed upon him in the best manner he can.<a id="FNanchor_259"
href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a></p>

<p>One of the remarkable features in this discourse is, its
business-like, impersonal character: it is Athens herself who
undertakes to commend and decorate her departed sons, as well as to
hearten up and admonish the living.</p>

<p>After a few words on the magnitude of the empire, and on the
glorious efforts as well as endurance whereby their forefathers and
they had acquired it,—Periklês proceeds to sketch the plan of life,
the constitution, and the manners, under which such achievements
were brought about.<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260"
class="fnanchor">[260]</a></p> <p><span class="pagenum"
id="Page_144">[p. 144]</span></p> <p>“We live under a constitution
such as noway to envy the laws of our neighbors,—ourselves an example
to others, rather than mere imitators. It is called a democracy,
since its permanent aim tends towards the many and not towards
the few: in regard to private matters and disputes, the laws deal
equally with every man: while looking to public affairs and to
claims of individual influence, every man’s chance of advancement
is determined, not by party-favor but by real worth, according as
his reputation stands in his own particular department: nor does
poverty, or obscure station, keep him back,<a id="FNanchor_261"
href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> if he really has
the means of benefiting the city. And our social march is free,
not merely in regard to public affairs, but also in regard to
intolerance of each other’s diversity of daily pursuits. For we
are not angry with our neighbor for what he may do to please
himself, nor do we ever put on those sour looks,<a id="FNanchor_262"
href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> which, though they do
no positive damage, are not the less sure to offend. Thus conducting
our private social intercourse with reciprocal indulgence, we are
restrained from wrong on public matters by fear and reverence of our
magistrates for the time being, and of our laws,—especially such
laws as are instituted for the protection of wrongful sufferers,
and even such others as, though not written, are enforced by a
common sense of shame. Besides this, we have provided for our minds
numerous recreations from toil, partly by our customary solemnities
of sacrifice and festival throughout the year, partly by the elegance
of our private establishments,—the daily charm of which banishes the
sense of discomfort. From the magnitude of our city, the products of
the whole earth are brought to us, so that our enjoyment of foreign
luxuries is as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[p. 145]</span>
much our own and assured as those which we grow at home. In respect
to training for war, we differ from our opponents (the Lacedæmonians)
on several material points. First, we lay open our city as a common
resort: we apply no xenêlasy to exclude even an enemy either from
any lesson or any spectacle, the full view of which he may think
advantageous to him; for we trust less to manœuvres and quackery than
to our native bravery, for warlike efficiency. Next, in regard to
education, while the Lacedæmonians, even from their earliest youth,
subject themselves to an irksome exercise for the attainment of
courage, we, with our easy habits of life, are not less prepared than
they, to encounter all perils within the measure of our strength.
The proof of this is, that the Peloponnesian confederates do not
attack us one by one, but with their whole united force; while we,
when we attack them at home, overpower for the most part all of them
who try to defend their own territory. None of our enemies has ever
met and contended with our entire force; partly in consequence of
our large navy,—partly from our dispersion in different simultaneous
land-expeditions. But when they chance to be engaged with any part
of it, if victorious, they pretend to have vanquished us all,—if
defeated, they pretend to have been vanquished by all.</p>

<p>“Now, if we are willing to brave danger, just as much under an
indulgent system as under constant toil, and by spontaneous courage
as much as under force of law,—we are gainers in the end, by not
vexing ourselves beforehand with sufferings to come, yet still
appearing in the hour of trial not less daring than those who toil
without ceasing.</p>

<p>“In other matters, too, as well as in these, our city deserves
admiration. For we combine elegance of taste with simplicity of life,
and we pursue knowledge without being enervated:<a id="FNanchor_263"
href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> we employ wealth, not
for talking and ostentation, but as a real help<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_146">[p. 146]</span> in the proper season: nor is it
disgraceful to any one who is poor to confess his poverty, though
he <i>may</i> rather incur reproach for not actually keeping himself
out of poverty. The magistrates who discharge public trusts fulfil
their domestic duties also,—the private citizen, while engaged in
professional business, has competent knowledge on public affairs:
for we stand alone in regarding the man who keeps aloof from these
latter, not as harmless, but as useless. Moreover, we always hear
and pronounce on public matters, when discussed by our leaders,—or
perhaps strike out for ourselves correct reasonings about them: far
from accounting discussion an impediment to action, we complain only
if we are not told what is to be done before it becomes our duty
to do it. For, in truth, we combine in the most remarkable manner
these two qualities,—extreme boldness in execution, with full debate
beforehand on that which we are going about: whereas, with others,
ignorance alone imparts boldness,—debate introduces hesitation.
Assuredly, those men are properly to be regarded as the stoutest
of heart, who, knowing most precisely both the terrors of war and
the sweets of peace, are still not the less willing to encounter
peril.</p>

<p>“In fine, I affirm that our city, considered as a whole, is the
schoolmistress of Greece;<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264"
class="fnanchor">[264]</a> while, viewed individually, we enable
the same man to furnish himself out and suffice to himself in the
greatest variety of ways, and with the most complete grace and
refinement. This is no empty boast of the moment, but genuine
reality: and the power of the city, acquired through the dispositions
just indicated, exists to prove it. Athens alone, of all cities,
stands forth in actual trial greater than her reputation: her enemy,
when he attacks her, will not have his pride wounded by suffering
defeat from feeble hands,—her subjects will not think themselves
degraded as if their obedience were paid to an unworthy superior.<a
id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a>
Having thus put forward our power, not<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_147">[p. 147]</span> uncertified, but backed by the most
evident proofs, we shall be admired not less by posterity than by
our contemporaries. Nor do we stand in need either of Homer or of
any other panegyrist, whose words may for the moment please, while
the truth when known would confute their intended meaning: we have
compelled all land and sea to become accessible to our courage, and
have planted everywhere imperishable monuments of our kindness as
well as of our hostility.</p>

<p>“Such is the city on behalf of which these warriors have nobly
died in battle, vindicating her just title to unimpaired rights,<a
id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a>—and
on behalf of which all of us here left behind must willingly toil.
It is for this reason that I have spoken at length concerning the
city, at once to draw from it the lesson that the conflict is not for
equal motives between us and enemies who possess nothing of the like
excellence,—and to demonstrate by proofs the truth of my encomium
pronounced upon her.”</p>

<p>Periklês pursues at considerable additional length the same tenor
of mixed exhortation to the living and eulogy of the dead; with
many special and emphatic observations addressed to the relatives
of the latter, who were assembled around and doubtless very near
him. But the extract which I have already made is so long, that
no farther addition would be admissible: yet it was impossible to
pass over lightly the picture of the Athenian commonwealth in its
glory, as delivered by the ablest citizen of the age. The effect
of the democratical constitution, with its diffused and equal
citizenship, in calling forth not merely strong attachment, but
painful self-sacrifice, on the part of all Athenians,—is nowhere more
forcibly insisted upon than in the words above cited of Periklês,
as well as in others afterwards: “Contemplating as you do daily
before you the actual power of the state, and becoming passionately
attached to it, when you conceive its full<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_148">[p. 148]</span> greatness, reflect that it was all
acquired by men of daring, acquainted with their duty, and full of
an honorable sense of shame in their actions,”<a id="FNanchor_267"
href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a>—such is the
association which he presents between the greatness of the state
as an object of common passion, and the courage, intelligence,
and mutual esteem, of individual citizens, as its creating and
preserving causes: poor as well as rich being alike interested in the
partnership.</p>

<p>But the claims of patriotism, though put forward as essentially
and deservedly paramount, are by no means understood to reign
exclusively, or to absorb the whole of the democratical activity.
Subject to these, and to those laws and sanctions which protect
both the public and individuals against wrong, it is the pride
of Athens to exhibit a rich and varied fund of human impulse,—an
unrestrained play of fancy and diversity of private pursuit,
coupled with a reciprocity of cheerful indulgence between one
individual and another, and an absence even of those “black looks”
which so much embitter life, even if they never pass into enmity
of fact. This portion of the speech of Periklês deserves peculiar
attention, because it serves to correct an assertion, often far too
indiscriminately made, respecting antiquity as contrasted with modern
societies,—an assertion that the ancient societies sacrificed the
individual to the state, and that only in modern times has individual
agency been left free to the proper extent. This is preëminently true
of Sparta: it is also true, in a great degree, of the ideal societies
depicted by Plato and Aristotle: but it is pointedly untrue of the
Athenian democracy, nor can we with any confidence predicate it of
the major part of the Grecian cities.</p>

<p>I shall hereafter return to this point when I reach the times of
the great speculative philosophers: in the mean time I cannot pass
over this speech of Periklês without briefly noticing the inference
which it suggests, to negative the supposed exorbitant<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[p. 149]</span> interference of the
state with individual liberty, as a general fact among the ancient
Greek republics. There is no doubt that he has present to his mind
a comparison with the extreme narrowness and rigor of Sparta, and
that therefore his assertions of the extent of positive liberty at
Athens must be understood as partially qualified by such contrast.
But even making allowance for this, the stress which he lays upon the
liberty of thought and action at Athens, not merely from excessive
restraint of law, but also from practical intolerance between man
and man, and tyranny of the majority over individual dissenters in
taste and pursuit,—deserves serious notice, and brings out one of
those points in the national character upon which the intellectual
development of the time mainly depended. The national temper was
indulgent in a high degree to all the varieties of positive impulses:
the peculiar promptings in every individual bosom were allowed
to manifest themselves and bear fruit, without being suppressed
by external opinion, or trained into forced conformity with some
assumed standard: antipathies against any of them formed no part of
the habitual morality of the citizen. While much of the generating
causes of human hatred was thus rendered inoperative, and while
society was rendered more comfortable, more instructive, and more
stimulating,—all its germs of productive fruitful genius, so rare
everywhere, found in such an atmosphere the maximum of encouragement.
Within the limits of the law, assuredly as faithfully observed at
Athens as anywhere in Greece, individual impulse, taste, and even
eccentricity, were accepted with indulgence, instead of being a mark
as elsewhere for the intolerance of neighbors or of the public.
This remarkable feature in Athenian life will help us in a future
chapter to explain the striking career of Sokratês, and it farther
presents to us, under another face, a great part of that which
the censors of Athens denounced under the name of “democratical
license.” The liberty and diversity of individual life in that city
were offensive to Xenophon,<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268"
class="fnanchor">[268]</a> Plato, and Aristotle,—attached
either<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[p. 150]</span> to the
monotonous drill of Sparta, or to some other ideal standard, which,
though much better than the Spartan in itself, they were disposed to
impress upon society with a heavy-handed uniformity. That liberty
of individual action, not merely from the over-restraints of law,
but from the tyranny of jealous opinion, such as Periklês depicts
in Athens, belongs more naturally to a democracy, where there is no
select one or few to receive worship and set the fashion, than to any
other form of government. But it is very rare even in democracies:
nor can we dissemble the fact that none of the governments of modern
times, democratical, aristocratical, or monarchical, presents any
thing like the picture of generous tolerance towards social dissent,
and spontaneity of individual taste, which we read in the speech
of the Athenian statesman. In all of them, the intolerance of the
national opinion cuts down individual character to one out of a few
set types, to which every person, or every family, is constrained
to adjust itself, and beyond which all exceptions meet either with
hatred or with derision. To impose upon men such restraints either
of law or of opinion as are requisite for the security and comfort
of society, but to encourage rather than repress the free play of
individual impulse subject to those limits,—is an ideal, which, if
it was ever approached at Athens, has certainly never been attained,
and has indeed comparatively been little studied or cared for in any
modern society.</p>

<p>Connected with this reciprocal indulgence of individual diversity,
was not only the hospitable reception of all strangers at Athens,
which Periklês contrasts with the xenêlasy or jealous expulsion
practised at Sparta,—but also the many-sided activity, bodily and
mental, visible in the former, so opposite to that narrow range
of thought, exclusive discipline of the body and never-ending
preparation for war, which formed the system of the latter. His
assertion that Athens was equal to Sparta, even in her own solitary
excellence,—efficiency on the field of battle,—is doubtless
untenable; but not the less impressive is his sketch of that
multitude of concurrent impulses which at this same time agitated
and impelled the Athenian mind,—the strength<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_151">[p. 151]</span> of one not implying the weakness of
the remainder: the relish for all pleasures of art and elegance,
and the appetite for intellectual expansion, coinciding in the same
bosom with energetic promptitude as well as endurance: abundance
of recreative spectacles, yet noway abating the cheerfulness
of obedience even to the hardest calls of patriotic duty: that
combination of reason and courage which encountered danger the
more willingly from having discussed and calculated it beforehand:
lastly, an anxious interest as well as a competence of judgment in
public discussion and public action, common to every citizen rich
and poor, and combined with every man’s own private industry. So
comprehensive an ideal of many-sided social development, bringing
out the capacities for action and endurance, as well as those for
enjoyment, would be sufficiently remarkable, even if we supposed it
only existing in the imagination of a philosopher: but it becomes
still more so when we recollect that the main features of it at least
were drawn from the fellow-citizens of the speaker. It must be taken,
however, as belonging peculiarly to the Athens of Periklês and his
contemporaries; nor would it have suited either the period of the
Persian war, fifty years before, or that of Demosthenês, seventy
years afterwards. At the former period, the art, the letters, and
the philosophy, were as yet backward, while even the active energy
and democratical stimulus, though very powerful, had not been worked
up to the pitch which they afterwards reached: at the latter period,
although the intellectual manifestations of Athens subsist in full
or even increased vigor, we shall find the personal enterprise
and energetic spirit of her citizens materially abated. As the
circumstances, which I have already recounted, go far to explain the
previous upward movement, so those which fill the coming chapters,
containing the disasters of the Peloponnesian war, will be found to
explain still more completely the declining tendency shortly about to
commence. Athens was brought to the brink of entire ruin, from which
it is surprising that she recovered at all,—but noway surprising
that she recovered at the expense of a considerable loss of personal
energy in the character of her citizens.</p>

<p>And thus the season at which Periklês delivered his discourse
lends to it an additional and peculiar pathos. It was delivered<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[p. 152]</span> at a time when Athens
was as yet erect and at her maximum for though her real power
was, doubtless, much diminished, compared with the period before
the thirty years’ truce, yet the great edifices and works of art,
achieved since then, tended to compensate that loss, in so far as
the sense of greatness was concerned; and no one, either citizen or
enemy, considered Athens as having at all declined. It was delivered
at the commencement of the great struggle with the Peloponnesian
confederacy, the coming hardships of which Periklês never disguised
either to himself or to his fellow-citizens, though he fully counted
upon eventual success. Attica had been already invaded; it was no
longer “the unwasted territory,” as Euripidês had designated it
in his tragedy Medea,<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269"
class="fnanchor">[269]</a> represented three or four months before
the march of Archidamus,—and a picture of Athens in her social glory
was well calculated both to rouse the pride and nerve the courage of
those individuals citizens, who had been compelled once, and would
be compelled again and again, to abandon their country-residence
and fields for a thin tent or confined hole in the city.<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[p. 153]</span><a id="FNanchor_270"
href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> Such calamities
might, indeed, be foreseen: but there was one still greater calamity,
which, though actually then impending, could not be foreseen: the
terrific pestilence which will be recounted in the coming chapter.
The bright colors, and tone of cheerful confidence, which pervade
the discourse of Periklês, appear the more striking from being in
immediate antecedence to the awful description of this distemper:
a contrast to which Thucydidês was, doubtless, not insensible,
and which is another circumstance enhancing the interest of the
composition.</p>

<div class="chapter pt3" id="Chap_49">
  <h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XLIX.<br />
    FROM THE BEGINNING OE THE SECOND YEAR DOWN TO THE
    END OF THE THIRD YEAR OF THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR.</h2>
</div>

<p class="ti0"><span class="smcap">At</span> the close of one
year after the attempted surprise of Platæa by the Thebans, the
belligerent parties in Greece remained in an unaltered position as
to relative strength. Nothing decisive had been accomplished on
either side, either by the invasion of Attica, or by the flying
descents round the coast of Peloponnesus: in spite of mutual damage
inflicted,—doubtless, in the greatest measure upon Attica,—no
progress was yet made towards the fulfilment of those objects which
had induced the Peloponnesians to go to war. Especially, the most
pressing among all their wishes—the relief of Potidæa—was noway
advanced; for the Athenians had not found it necessary to relax the
blockade of that city. The result of the first year’s operations had
thus been to disappoint the hopes of the Corinthians and the other
ardent instigators of war, while it justified the anticipations both
of Periklês and of Archidamus.</p>

<p>A second devastation of Attica was resolved upon for the
commencement of spring; and measures were taken for carrying it
all over that territory, since the settled policy of Athens<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[p. 154]</span> not to hazard a battle
with the invaders was now ascertained. About the end of March, or
beginning of April, the entire Peloponnesian force—two-thirds from
each confederate city, as before—was assembled under the command of
Archidamus, and marched into Attica. This time they carried the work
of systematic destruction, not merely over the Thriasian plain and
the plain immediately near to Athens, as before; but also to the
more southerly portions of Attica, down even as far as the mines of
Laurium. They traversed and ravaged both the eastern and the western
coast, remaining not less than forty days in the country. They
found the territory deserted as before, all the population having
retired within the walls.<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271"
class="fnanchor">[271]</a></p>

<p>In regard to this second invasion, Periklês recommended the same
defensive policy as he had applied to the first; and, apparently,
the citizens had now come to acquiesce in it, if not willingly, at
least with a full conviction of its necessity. But a new visitation
had now occurred, diverting their attention from the invader, though
enormously aggravating their sufferings. A few days after Archidamus
entered Attica, a pestilence, or epidemic sickness, broke out
unexpectedly at Athens.</p>

<p>It appears that this terrific disorder had been raging for
some time throughout the regions round the Mediterranean; having
begun, as was believed, in Æthiopia,—thence passing into Egypt and
Libya, and overrunning a considerable portion of Asia under the
Persian government: about sixteen years before, too, there had
been a similar calamity in Rome and in various parts of Italy.
Recently, it had been felt in Lemnos and some other islands of
the Ægean, yet seemingly not with such intensity as to excite
much notice generally in the Grecian world: at length it passed
to Athens, and first showed itself in the Peiræus. The progress
of the disease was as rapid and destructive as its appearance
had been sudden; whilst the extraordinary accumulation of people
within the city and long walls, in consequence of the presence of
the invaders in the country, was but too favorable to every form
of contagion. Families crowded together in close cabins and places
of temporary shelter,<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272"
class="fnanchor">[272]</a>—throughout a city constructed,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[p. 155]</span> like most of those in
Greece, with little regard to the conditions of salubrity,—and in a
state of mental chagrin from the forced abandonment and sacrifice of
their properties in the country, transmitted the disorder with fatal
facility from one to the other. Beginning as it did about the middle
of April, the increasing heat of summer farther aided the disorder,
the symptoms of which, alike violent and sudden, made themselves the
more remarked because the year was particularly exempt from maladies
of every other description.<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273"
class="fnanchor">[273]</a></p>

<p>Of this plague,—or, more properly, eruptive typhoid fever,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[p. 156]</span><a id="FNanchor_274"
href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> distinct from,
yet analogous to, the smallpox,—a description no less clear than
impressive has been left by the historian Thucydidês, himself not
only a spectator but a sufferer. It is not one of the least of
his merits, that his notice of the symptoms, given at so early a
stage of medical science and observation, is such as to instruct
the medical reader of the present age, and to enable the malady to
be understood and identified. The observations, with which that
notice is ushered in, deserve particular attention. “In respect
to this distemper (he says), let every man, physician or not, say
what he thinks respecting the source from whence it may probably
have arisen, and respecting the causes which he deems sufficiently
powerful to have produced so great a revolution. But I, having myself
had the distemper, and having seen others suffering under it, will
state <i>what it actually was</i>, and will indicate, in addition, such
other matters, as will furnish any man, who lays them to heart,
with knowledge and the means of calculation beforehand, in case
the same misfortune should ever again occur.”<a id="FNanchor_275"
href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> To record past facts,
as a basis for rational pre<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[p.
157]</span>vision in regard to the future,—the same sentiment
which Thucydidês mentions in his preface,<a id="FNanchor_276"
href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> as having animated
him to the composition of his history,—was at that time a duty so
little understood, that we have reason to admire not less the manner
in which he performs it in practice, than the distinctness with
which he conceives it in theory. We may infer from his language
that speculation in his day was active respecting the causes of
this plague, according to the vague and fanciful physics and scanty
stock of ascertained facts, which was all that could then be
consulted. By resisting the itch of theorising from one of those
loose hypotheses which then appeared plausibly to explain everything,
he probably renounced the point of view from which most credit and
interest would be derivable at the time: but his simple and precise
summary of observed facts carries with it an imperishable value,
and even affords grounds for imagining, that he was no stranger to
the habits and training of his contemporary, Hippokratês, and the
other Asklepiads of Cos.<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277"
class="fnanchor">[277]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[p. 158]</span></p>

<p>It is hardly within the province of an historian of Greece
to repeat after Thucydidês the painful enumeration of symptoms,
violent in the extreme, and pervading every portion of the bodily
system, which marked this fearful disorder. Beginning in Peiræus,
it quickly passed into the city, and both the one and the other
was speedily filled with sickness and suffering, the like of which
had never before been known. The seizures were perfectly sudden,
and a large proportion of the sufferers perished, after deplorable
agonies, on the seventh or on the ninth day: others, whose strength
of constitution carried them over this period, found themselves
the victims of exhausting and incurable diarrhœa afterwards: with
others again, after traversing both these stages, the distemper
fixed itself in some particular member, the eyes, the genitals, the
hands, or the feet, which were rendered permanently useless, or in
some cases amputated, even where the patient himself recovered.
There were also some whose recovery was attended with a total loss
of memory, so that they no more knew themselves or recognized their
friends. No treatment or remedy appearing, except in accidental
cases, to produce any beneficial effect, the physicians or surgeons
whose aid was invoked became completely at fault; while trying
their accustomed means without avail, they soon ended by catching
the malady themselves and perishing: nor were the charms and<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[p. 159]</span> incantations<a
id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> to
which the unhappy patient resorted, likely to be more efficacious.
While some asserted that the Peloponnesians had poisoned the
cisterns of water, others referred the visitation to the wrath of
the gods, and especially to Apollo, known by hearers of the Iliad
as author of pestilence in the Greek host before Troy. It was
remembered that this Delphian god had promised the Lacedæmonians,
in reply to their application immediately before the war, that he
would assist them whether invoked or uninvoked,—and the disorder
now raging was ascribed to the intervention of their irresistible
ally: while the elderly men farther called to mind an oracular verse
sung in the time of their youth: “The Dorian war will come, and
pestilence along with it.”<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279"
class="fnanchor">[279]</a> Under the distress which suggested, and
was reciprocally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[p. 160]</span>
aggravated by, these gloomy ideas, prophets were consulted, and
supplications with solemn procession were held at the temples, to
appease the divine wrath.</p>

<p>When it was found that neither the priest nor the physician could
retard the spread, or mitigate the intensity, of the disorder, the
Athenians abandoned themselves to utter despair, and the space within
the walls became a scene of desolating misery. Every man attacked
with the malady at once lost his courage,—a state of depression,
itself among the worst features of the case, which made him lie down
and die, without the least attempt to seek for any preservatives. And
though, at first, friends and relatives lent their aid to tend the
sick with the usual family sympathies, yet so terrible was the number
of these attendants who perished, “like sheep,” from such contact,
that at length no man would thus expose himself; while the most
generous spirits, who persisted longest in the discharge of their
duty, were carried off in the greatest numbers.<a id="FNanchor_280"
href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> The patient was thus
left to die alone and unheeded: sometimes all the inmates of a house
were swept away one after the other, no man being willing to go near
it: desertion on one hand, attendance on the other, both tended to
aggravate the calamity. There remained only those who, having had
the disorder and recovered, were willing to tend the sufferers.
These men formed the single exception to the all-pervading misery
of the time,—for the disorder seldom attacked any one twice, and
when it did, the second attack was never fatal. Elate with their own
escape, they deemed themselves out of the reach of all disease, and
were full of compassionate kindness for others whose sufferings were
just beginning. It was from them, too, that the principal attention
to the bodies of deceased victims proceeded: for such was the state
of dismay and sorrow, that even the nearest relatives neglected the
sepulchral duties, sacred beyond all others in the eyes of a Greek.
Nor is there any circumstance which conveys to us so vivid an idea
of the prevalent agony and despair, as when we read, in the words of
an eye-witness, that the deaths took place among this close-packed
crowd<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[p. 161]</span>
without the smallest decencies of attention,<a id="FNanchor_281"
href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a>—that the dead and the
dying lay piled one upon another, not merely in the public roads, but
even in the temples, in spite of the understood defilement of the
sacred building,—that half-dead sufferers were seen lying round all
the springs, from insupportable thirst,—that the numerous corpses
thus unburied and exposed, were in such a condition, that the dogs
which meddled with them died in consequence, while no vultures or
other birds of the like habits ever came near. Those bodies which
escaped entire neglect, were burnt or buried<a id="FNanchor_282"
href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> without the
customary mourning, and with unseemly carelessness. In some cases,
the bearers of a body, passing by a funeral pile on which another
body was burning, would put their own there to be burnt also;<a
id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> or
perhaps, if the pile was prepared ready for a body not yet arrived,
would deposit their own upon it, set fire to the pile, and then
depart. Such indecent confusion would have been intolerable to the
feelings of the Athenians, in any ordinary times.</p>

<p>To all these scenes of physical suffering, death, and reckless
despair, was superadded another evil, which affected those who were
fortunate enough to escape the rest. The bonds both of law and
morality became relaxed, amidst such total uncertainty of every
man both for his own life, and that of others. Men cared not to
abstain from wrong, under circumstances in which punishment was not
likely to overtake them,—nor to put a check upon their passions,
and endure privations in obedience even to<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_162">[p. 162]</span> their strongest conviction, when the
chance was so small of their living to reap reward or enjoy any
future esteem. An interval short and sweet, before their doom was
realized—before they became plunged in the wide-spread misery which
they witnessed around, and which affected indiscriminately the
virtuous and the profligate—was all they looked to enjoy; embracing
with avidity the immediate pleasures of sense, as well as such
positive gains, however ill-gotten, as could be made the means of
procuring them, and throwing aside all thought both of honor or of
long-sighted advantage. Life and property were alike ephemeral, nor
was there any hope left but to snatch a moment of enjoyment, before
the outstretched hand of destiny should fall upon its victims.</p>

<p>The melancholy picture of society under the pressure of
a murderous epidemic, with its train of physical torments,
wretchedness, and demoralization, has been drawn by more than
one eminent author, but by none with more impressive fidelity
and conciseness than by Thucydidês,<a id="FNanchor_284"
href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> who had no
predecessor, and nothing but the reality to copy from. We may
remark that, amidst all the melancholy accompaniments of the time,
there are no human sacrifices, such as those offered up at Carthage
during pestilence to appease the anger of the gods,—there are
no cruel persecutions against imaginary authors of the disease,
such as those against the Untori (anointers of doors) in the
plague of Milan in 1630.<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285"
class="fnanchor">[285]</a> Three years altogether did this calamity
desolate Athens: continuously, during the entire second and third
years of the war,—after which, followed a period of marked abatement
for a year and a half: but it then revived again, and lasted
for another year, with the same fury as at first. The pub<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[p. 163]</span>lic loss, over and
above the private misery, which this unexpected enemy inflicted
upon Athens, was incalculable. Out of twelve hundred horsemen,
all among the rich men of the state, three hundred died of the
epidemic; besides four thousand and four hundred hoplites out of the
roll formerly kept, and a number of the poorer population so great
as to defy computation.<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286"
class="fnanchor">[286]</a> No efforts of the Peloponnesians
could have done so much to ruin Athens, or to bring the war to a
termination such as they desired: and the distemper told the more
in their favor, as it never spread at all into Peloponnesus, though
it passed from Athens to some of the more populous islands.<a
id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> The
Lacedæmonian army was withdrawn from Attica somewhat earlier than
it would otherwise have been, for fear of taking the contagion.<a
id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a></p>

<p>But it was while the Lacedæmonians were yet in Attica, and during
the first freshness of the terrible malady, that Periklês equipped
and conducted from Peiræus an armament of one hundred triremes,
and four thousand hoplites to attack the coasts of Peloponnesus:
three hundred horsemen were also carried in some horse-transports,
prepared for the occasion out of old triremes. To diminish the crowd
accumulated in the city, was doubtless of beneficial tendency,
and perhaps those who went aboard, might consider it as a chance
of escape to quit an infected home. But unhappily they carried
the infection along with them, which desolated the fleet not less
than the city, and crippled all its efforts. Reinforced by fifty
ships of war from Chios and Lesbos, the Athenians first landed near
Epidaurus in Peloponnesus, ravaging the territory, and making an
unavailing attempt upon the city: next, they made like incursions
on the more southerly portions of the Argolic peninsula,—Trœzen,
Halieis, and Hermionê; and lastly attacked and captured Prasiæ,
on the eastern coast of Laconia. On returning to Athens, the same
armament<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[p. 164]</span> was
immediately conducted, under Agnon and Kleopompus, to press the
siege of Potidæa, the blockade of which still continued without
any visible progress. On arriving there, an attack was made on the
walls by battering engines, and by the other aggressive methods then
practised; but nothing whatever was achieved. In fact, the armament
became incompetent for all serious effort, from the aggravated
character which the distemper here assumed, communicated by the
soldiers fresh from Athens, even to those who had before been free
from it at Potidæa. So frightful was the mortality, that out of the
four thousand hoplites under Agnon, no less than ten hundred and
fifty died in the short space of forty days. The armament was brought
back in this melancholy condition to Athens, while the reduction
of Potidæa was left, as before, to the slow course of blockade.<a
id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a></p>

<p>On returning from the expedition against Peloponnesus, Periklês
found his countrymen almost distracted<a id="FNanchor_290"
href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> with their manifold
sufferings. Over and above the raging epidemic, they had just gone
over Attica and ascertained the devastations committed by the
invaders throughout all the territory—except the Marathonian<a
id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a>
Tetrapolis and Dekeleia; districts spared, as we are told, through
indulgence founded on an ancient legendary sympathy—during their long
stay of forty days. The rich had found their comfortable mansions
and farms, the poor their modest cottages, in the various demes,
torn down and ruined. Death,<a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292"
class="fnanchor">[292]</a> sickness, loss of property, and despair
of the future, now rendered the Athenians angry and intractable to
the last degree; and they vented their feelings against Periklês,
as the cause, not merely of the war, but also of all that they were
now enduring. Either with or without his consent, they sent envoys
to Sparta to open negotiations for peace, but the Spartans turned a
deaf ear to the proposition. This new disappointment rendered them
still more furious against Periklês, whose long-standing political
enemies now doubtless found strong sympathy in their denuncia<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[p. 165]</span>tions of his character
and policy. That unshaken and majestic firmness, which ranked
first among his many eminent qualities, was never more imperiously
required, and never more effectively manifested. In his capacity
of stratêgus, or general, he convoked a formal assembly of the
people, for the purpose of vindicating himself publicly against the
prevailing sentiment, and recommending perseverance in his line of
policy. The speeches made by his opponents, assuredly very bitter,
are not given by Thucydidês; but that of Periklês himself is set
down at considerable length, and a memorable discourse it is. It
strikingly brings into relief both the character of the man and the
impress of actual circumstances,—an impregnable mind, conscious not
only of right purposes, but of just and reasonable anticipations,
and bearing up with manliness, or even defiance, against the natural
difficulty of the case, heightened by an extreme of incalculable
misfortune. He had foreseen,<a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293"
class="fnanchor">[293]</a> while advising the war originally, the
probable impatience of his countrymen under its first hardships, but
he could not foresee the epidemic by which that impatience had been
exasperated into madness: and he now addressed them, not merely with
unabated adherence to his own deliberate convictions, but also in
a tone of reproachful remonstrance against their unmerited change
of sentiment towards him,—seeking at the same time to combat that
uncontrolled despair which, for the moment, overlaid both their pride
and their patriotism. Far from humbling himself before the present
sentiment, it is at this time that he sets forth his titles to their
esteem in the most direct and unqualified manner, and claims the
continuance of that which they had so long accorded, as something
belonging to him by acquired right.</p>

<p>His main object, throughout this discourse, is to fill the minds
of his audience with patriotic sympathy for the weal of the entire
city, so as to counterbalance the absorbing sense of private woe.
If the collective city flourishes, he argues, private misfortunes
may at least be borne: but no amount of private prosperity will
avail, if the collective city falls; a proposition literally
true in ancient times, and under the circumstances of ancient
warfare, though less true at present. “Distracted by domestic
calamity,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[p. 166]</span> ye
are now angry both with me, who advised you to go to war, and with
yourselves, who followed the advice. Ye listened to me, considering
me superior to others in judgment, in speech, in patriotism, and
in incorruptible probity,<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294"
class="fnanchor">[294]</a>—nor ought I now to be treated as
culpable for giving such advice, when in point of fact the war
was unavoidable, and there would have been still greater danger
in shrinking from it. I am the same man, still unchanged,—but ye,
in your misfortunes, cannot stand to the convictions which ye
adopted when yet unhurt. Extreme and unforeseen, indeed, are the
sorrows which have fallen upon you: yet, inhabiting as ye do a
great city, and brought up in dispositions suitable to it, ye must
also resolve to bear up against the utmost pressure of adversity,
and never to surrender your dignity. I have often explained to you
that ye have no reason to doubt of eventual success in the war,
but I will now remind you, more emphatically than before, and even
with a degree of ostentation suitable as a stimulus to your present
unnatural depression,—that your naval force makes you masters, not
only of your allies, but of the entire sea,<a id="FNanchor_295"
href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a>—one half of the
visible field for action and employment. Compared with so vast a
power as this, the temporary use of your houses and territory is
a mere trifle,—an ornamental accessory not worth considering; and
this, too, if ye preserve your freedom, ye will quickly recover. It
was your fathers who first gained this empire, without any of the
advantages which ye now enjoy; ye must not disgrace yourselves by
losing what they acquired. Delighting as ye all do in the honor and
empire enjoyed by the city, ye must not shrink from the toils whereby
alone that honor is sustained: moreover, ye now fight, not merely
for freedom instead of slavery, but for empire<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_167">[p. 167]</span> against loss of empire, with all the
perils arising out of imperial unpopularity. It is not safe for you
now to abdicate, even if ye chose to do so; for ye hold your empire
like a despotism,—unjust perhaps in the original acquisition, but
ruinous to part with when once acquired. Be not angry with me, whose
advice ye followed in going to war, because the enemy have done
such damage as might be expected from them; still less on account
of this unforeseen distemper: I know that this makes me an object
of your special present hatred, though very unjustly, unless ye
will consent to give me credit also for any unexpected good luck
which may occur. Our city derives its particular glory from unshaken
bearing up against misfortune: her power, her name, her empire of
Greeks over Greeks, are such as have never before been seen: and
if we choose to be great, we must take the consequence of that
temporary envy and hatred which is the necessary price of permanent
renown. Behave ye now in a manner worthy of that glory: display
that courage which is essential to protect you against disgrace at
present, as well as to guarantee your honor for the future. Send no
farther embassy to Sparta, and bear your misfortunes without showing
symptoms of distress.”<a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296"
class="fnanchor">[296]</a></p>

<p>The irresistible reason, as well as the proud and resolute
bearing of this discourse, set forth with an eloquence which it
was not possible for Thucydidês to reproduce,—together with the
age and character of Periklês,—carried the assent of the assembled
people; who, when in the Pnyx, and engaged according to habit on
public matters, would for a moment forget their private sufferings
in considerations of the safety and grandeur of Athens: possibly,
indeed, those sufferings, though still continuing, might become
somewhat alleviated when the invaders quitted Attica, and when
it was no longer indispensable for all the population to confine
itself within the walls. Accordingly, the assembly resolved that
no farther propositions should be made for peace, and that the war
should be prosecuted with vigor. But though the public resolution
thus adopted showed the ancient habit of deference to the authority
of Periklês, the sentiments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[p.
168]</span> of individuals taken separately were still those of anger
against him, as the author of that system which had brought them
into so much distress. His political opponents—Kleon, Simmias, or
Lakratidas, perhaps all three in conjunction—took care to provide
an opportunity for this prevalent irritation to manifest itself in
act, by bringing an accusation against him before the dikastery. The
accusation is said to have been preferred on the ground of pecuniary
malversation, and ended by his being sentenced to pay a considerable
fine, the amount of which is differently reported,—fifteen, fifty,
or eighty talents, by different authors.<a id="FNanchor_297"
href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> The accusing party
thus appeared to have carried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[p.
169]</span> their point, and to have disgraced, as well as excluded
from reëlection, the veteran statesman. But the event disappointed
their expectations: the imposition of the fine not only satiated
all the irritation of the people against him, but even occasioned
a serious reaction in his favor, and brought back as strongly as
ever the ancient sentiment of esteem and admiration. It was quickly
found that those who had succeeded Periklês as generals, neither
possessed nor deserved in an equal degree, the public confidence,
and he was accordingly soon reëlected, with as much power and
influence as he had ever in his life enjoyed.<a id="FNanchor_298"
href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a></p>

<p>But that life—long, honorable, and useful—had already been
prolonged considerably beyond the sixtieth year, and there were
but too many circumstances, besides the recent fine, which tended
to hasten as well as to embitter its close. At the very moment
when Periklês was preaching to his countrymen, in a tone almost
reproachful, the necessity of manful and unabated devotion to the
common country, in the midst of private suffering,—he was himself
among the greatest of sufferers, and most hardly pressed to set
the example of observing his own precepts. The epidemic carried
off not merely his two sons, the only two legitimate, Xanthippus
and Paralus, but also his sister, several other relatives, and
his best and most useful political friends. Amidst this train of
domestic calamities, and in the funeral obsequies of so many of his
dearest friends, he remained master of his grief, and maintained
his habitual self-command, until the last misfortune,—the death
of his favorite son Paralus, which left his house without any
legitimate representative to maintain the family and the hereditary
sacred rites. On this final blow, though he strove to command
himself as before, yet, at the obsequies of the young man, when
it became his duty to place a garland on the dead body, his grief
became uncontrollable, and he burst out, for the first time of
his life, into profuse tears and sobbing.<a id="FNanchor_299"
href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a></p>

<p>In the midst of these several personal trials he received the
intimation, through Alkibiadês and some other friends, of the
restored confidence of the people towards him, and of his re-election
to the office of stratêgus: nor was it without difficulty<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[p. 170]</span> that he was persuaded
to present himself again at the public assembly, and resume the
direction of affairs. The regret of the people was formally
expressed to him for the recent sentence,—perhaps, indeed, the
fine may have been repaid to him, or some evasion of it permitted,
saving the forms of law,<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300"
class="fnanchor">[300]</a>—in the present temper of the city; which
was farther displayed towards him by the grant of a remarkable
exemption from a law of his own original proposition. He had
himself, some years before, been the author of that law, whereby
the citizenship of Athens was restricted to persons born both of
Athenian fathers and Athenian mothers, under which restriction
several thousand persons, illegitimate on the mother’s side, are
said to have been deprived of the citizenship, on occasion of a
public distribution of corn. Invidious as it appeared to grant, to
Periklês singly, an exemption from a law which had been strictly
enforced against so many others, the people were now moved not
less by compassion than by anxiety to redress their own previous
severity. Without a legitimate heir, the house of Periklês, one
branch of the great Alkmæônid gens by his mother’s side, would be
left deserted, and the continuity of the family sacred rites would
be broken,—a misfortune painfully felt by every Athenian family,
as calculated to wrong all the deceased members, and provoke their
posthumous displeasure towards the city. Accordingly, permission was
granted to Periklês to legitimize, and to inscribe in his own gens
and phratry his natural son by Aspasia, who bore his own name.<a
id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a></p>

<p>It was thus that Periklês was reinstated in his post of stratêgus,
as well as in his ascendency over the public counsels,—seemingly
about August or September, 430 <small>B.C.</small>
He lived about one year longer, and seems to have maintained his
influence as long as his health permitted. Yet we hear nothing of
him after this moment, and he fell a victim, not to the violent
symptoms of the epidemic, but to a slow and wearing fever,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[p. 171]</span><a id="FNanchor_302"
href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> which underminded
his strength as well as his capacity. To a friend who came to
ask after him when in this disease, Periklês replied by showing
a charm or amulet which his female relations had hung about his
neck,—a proof how low he was reduced, and how completely he had
become a passive subject in the hands of others. And according to
another anecdote which we read, yet more interesting and equally
illustrative of his character,—it was during his last moments, when
he was lying apparently unconscious and insensible, that the friends
around his bed were passing in review the acts of his life, and
the nine trophies which he had erected at different times for so
many victories. He heard what they said, though they fancied that
he was past hearing, and interrupted them by remarking: “What you
praise in my life, belongs partly to good fortune,—and is, at best,
common to me with many other generals. But the peculiarity of which
I am most proud, you have not noticed,—no Athenian has ever put on
mourning on my account.”<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303"
class="fnanchor">[303]</a></p>

<p>Such a cause of self-gratulation, doubtless more satisfactory to
recall at such a moment than any other, illustrates that long-sighted
calculation, aversion to distant or hazardous enterprise, and economy
of the public force, which marked his entire political career; a
career long, beyond all parallel, in the history of Athens,—since
he maintained a great influence, gradually swelling into a decisive
personal ascendency, for between thirty and forty years. His
character has been presented in very different lights, by different
authors, both ancient and modern, and our materials for striking
the balance are not so good as we could wish. But his immense and
long-continued ascendency, as well as his unparalleled eloquence, are
facts attested not less by his enemies than by his friends,—nay, even
more forcibly by the former than by the latter. The comic writers,
who hated him, and whose trade it was to deride and hunt down every
leading political character, exhaust their powers of illustration
in setting forth both the one and the other:<a id="FNanchor_304"
href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> Telekleidês,
Kratinus, Eupolis,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[p.
172]</span> Aristophanês, all hearers and all enemies, speak
of him like Olympian Zeus, hurling thunder and lightning,—like
Hêraklês and Achilles,—as the only speaker on whose lips persuasion
sat, and who left his sting in the minds of his audience: while
Plato the philosopher,<a id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305"
class="fnanchor">[305]</a> who disapproved of his political working,
and of the moral effects which he produced upon Athens, nevertheless
extols his intellectual and oratorical ascendency: “his majestic
intelligence,”—in language not less decisive than Thucydidês.
There is another point of eulogy, not less valuable, on which the
testimony appears uncontradicted: throughout his long career,
amidst the hottest political animosities, the conduct of Periklês
towards opponents was always mild and liberal.<a id="FNanchor_306"
href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> The conscious
self-esteem and arrogance of manner with which the contemporary
poet Ion reproached him,<a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307"
class="fnanchor">[307]</a> contrasting it with the unpretending
simplicity of his own patron Kimon,—though probably invidiously
exaggerated, is doubtless in substance well founded, and those who
read the last speech given above out of Thucydidês, will at once
recognize in it this attribute. His natural taste, his love of
philosophical research, and his unwearied application to public
affairs, all contributed to alienate him from ordinary familiarity,
and to make him careless, perhaps improperly careless, of the lesser
means of conciliating public favor.</p>

<p>But admitting this latter reproach to be well founded, as it
seems to be, it helps to negative that greater and graver political
crime which has been imputed to him, of sacrificing the permanent
well-being and morality of the state to the maintenance of his own
political power,—of corrupting the people by distributions of the
public money. “He gave the reins to the people (in Plutarch’s words<a
id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a>),
and shaped his administration for their<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_173">[p. 173]</span> immediate favor, by always providing at
home some public spectacle, or festival, or procession, thus nursing
up the city in elegant pleasures,—and by sending out every year
sixty triremes, manned by citizen-seamen on full pay, who were thus
kept in practice and acquired nautical skill.” Now the charge here
made against Periklês, and supported by allegations in themselves
honorable rather than otherwise,—of a vicious appetite for immediate
popularity, and of improper concessions to the immediate feelings
of the people against their permanent interests,—is precisely that
which Thucydidês, in the most pointed manner denies; and not merely
denies, but contrasts Periklês with his successors in the express
circumstances that <i>they</i> did so, while <i>he</i> did not. The language of
the contemporary historian<a id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309"
class="fnanchor">[309]</a> well deserves to be cited: “Periklês,
powerful from dignity of character as well as from wisdom, and
conspicuously above the least tinge of corruption, held back the
people with a free hand, and was their real leader instead of
being led by them. For not being a seeker of power from unworthy
sources, he did not speak with any view to present favor, but had
sufficient sense of dignity to contradict<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_174">[p. 174]</span> them on occasion, even braving their
displeasure. Thus, whenever he perceived them insolently and
unseasonably confident, he shaped his speeches in such manner as to
alarm and beat them down: when again he saw them unduly frightened,
he tried to counteract it, and restore them confidence: so that
the government was in name a democracy, but in reality an empire
exercised by the first citizen in the state. But those who succeeded
after his death, being more equal one with another, and each of them
desiring preëminence over the rest, adopted the different course of
courting the favor of the people, and sacrificing to that object even
important state-interests. From whence arose many other bad measures,
as might be expected in a great and imperial city, and especially the
Sicilian expedition,” etc.</p>

<p>It will be seen that the judgment here quoted from Thucydidês
contradicts, in the most unqualified manner, the reproaches commonly
made against Periklês, of having corrupted the Athenian people
by distributions of the public money, and by giving way to their
unwise caprices, for the purpose of acquiring and maintaining his
own political power. Nay, the historian particularly notes the
opposite qualities,—self-judgment, conscious dignity, indifference
to immediate popular applause or wrath, when set against what was
permanently right and useful,—as the special characteristic of that
great statesman. A distinction might indeed be possible, and Plutarch
professes to note such distinction, between the earlier and the later
part of his long political career: he began, so that biographer
says, by corrupting the people in order to acquire power, but having
acquired it, he employed it in an independent and patriotic manner,
so that the judgment of Thucydidês, true respecting the later part of
his life, would not be applicable to the earlier. This distinction
may be to a certain degree well founded, inasmuch as the power of
opposing a bold and successful resistance to temporary aberrations of
the public mind, necessarily implies an established influence, and
can hardly ever be exercised even by the firmest politician during
his years of commencement: he is at that time necessarily the adjunct
of some party or tendency which he finds already in operation, and
has to stand forward actively and assiduously before he can create
for himself a separate personal influence. But while we admit the
distinction to this extent,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[p.
175]</span> there is nothing to warrant us in restricting the
encomium of Thucydidês exclusively to the later life of Periklês, or
in representing the earlier life as something in pointed contrast
with that encomium. Construing fairly what the historian says, he
evidently did not so conceive the earlier life of Periklês. Either
those political changes which are held by Plato, Aristotle, Plutarch,
and others, to demonstrate the corrupting effect of Periklês and
his political ascendency,—such as the limitation of the functions
of the Areopagus, as well as of the power of the magistrates, the
establishment of the numerous and frequent popular dikasteries with
regular pay, and perhaps also the assignment of pay to those who
attended the ekklesia, the expenditure for public works, religious
edifices and ornaments, the diobely (or distribution of two oboli per
head to the poorer citizens at various festivals, in order that they
might be able to pay for their places in the theatre), taking it as
it then stood, etc.,—did not appear to Thucydidês mischievous and
corrupting, as these other writers thought them; or else he did not
particularly refer them to Periklês.</p>

<p>Both are true, probably, to some extent. The internal political
changes at Athens, respecting the Areopagus and the dikasteries, took
place when Periklês was a young man, and when he cannot be supposed
to have yet acquired the immense personal ascendency which afterwards
belonged to him. Ephialtês in fact seems in those early days to have
been a greater man than Periklês, if we may judge by the fact that
he was selected by his political adversaries for assassination,—so
that they might with greater propriety be ascribed to the party with
which Periklês was connected, rather than to that statesman himself.
But next, we have no reason to presume that Thucydidês considered
these changes as injurious, or as having deteriorated the Athenian
character. All that he does say as to the working of Periklês on the
sentiment and actions of his countrymen, is eminently favorable. He
represents the presidency of that statesman as moderate, cautious,
conservative, and successful; he describes him as uniformly
keeping back the people from rash enterprises, and from attempts
to extend their empire,—as looking forward to the necessity of a
war, and maintaining the naval, military, and financial forces of
the state in constant condition to stand it,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_176">[p. 176]</span>—as calculating, with long-sighted
wisdom, the conditions on which ultimate success depended. If we
follow the elaborate funeral harangue of Periklês, which Thucydidês,
since he produces it at length, probably considered as faithfully
illustrating the political point of view of that statesman, we shall
discover a conception of democratical equality no less rational
than generous; an anxious care for the recreation and comfort of
the citizens, but no disposition to emancipate them from active
obligation, either public or private,—and least of all, any idea of
dispensing with such activity by abusive largesses out of the general
revenue. The whole picture, drawn by Periklês, of Athens, “as the
schoolmistress of Greece,” implies a prominent development of private
industry and commerce, not less than of public citizenship and
soldiership,—of letters, arts, and recreative varieties of taste.</p>

<p>Though Thucydidês does not directly canvass the constitutional
changes effected in Athens under Periklês, yet everything which he
does say leads us to believe that he accounted the working of that
statesman, upon the whole, on Athenian power as well as on Athenian
character, eminently valuable, and his death as an irreparable loss.
And we may thus appeal to the judgment of an historian who is our
best witness in every conceivable respect, as a valid reply to the
charge against Periklês, of having corrupted the Athenian habits,
character, and government. If he spent a large amount of the public
treasure upon religious edifices and ornaments, and upon stately
works for the city,—yet the sum which he left untouched, ready
for use at the beginning of the Peloponnesian war, was such as to
appear more than sufficient for all purposes of defence, or public
safety, or military honor. It cannot be shown of Periklês that he
ever sacrificed the greater object to the less,—the permanent and
substantially valuable, to the transitory and showy,—assured present
possessions, to the lust of new, distant, or uncertain conquests.
If his advice had been listened to, the rashness which brought on
the defeat of the Athenian Tolmidês, at Korôneia in Bœotia, would
have been avoided, and Athens might probably have maintained her
ascendency over Megara and Bœotia, which would have protected her
territory from invasion, and given a new turn to the subsequent
history. Periklês is not to be treated as the author of the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[p. 177]</span> Athenian character:
he found it with its very marked positive characteristics and
susceptibilities, among which, those which he chiefly brought out and
improved were the best. The lust of expeditions against the Persians,
which Kimon would have pushed into Egypt and Cyprus, he repressed,
after it had accomplished all which could be usefully aimed at:
the ambition of Athens he moderated rather than encouraged: the
democratical movement of Athens he regularized, and worked out into
judicial institutions, which became one of the prominent features of
Athenian life, and worked, in my judgment, with a very large balance
of benefit to the national mind as well as to individual security,
in spite of the many defects in their direct character as tribunals.
But that point in which there was the greatest difference between
Athens, as Periklês found if, and as he left it, is, unquestionably,
the pacific and intellectual development,—rhetoric, poetry, arts,
philosophical research, and recreative variety. To which if we add,
great improvement in the cultivation of the Attic soil,—extension of
Athenian trade,—attainment and laborious maintenance of the maximum
of maritime skill, attested by the battles of Phormio,—enlargement
of the area of complete security by construction of the Long
Walls,—lastly, the clothing of Athens in her imperial mantle, by
ornaments, architectural and sculptural,—we shall make out a case
of genuine progress realized during the political life of Periklês,
such as the evils imputed to him, far more imaginary than real, will
go but a little way to alloy. How little, comparatively speaking,
of the picture drawn by Periklês in his funeral harangue of 431
<small>B.C.</small> would have been correct, if the
harangue had been delivered over those warriors who fell at Tanagra,
twenty-seven years before!</p>

<p>It has been remarked by M. Boeckh,<a id="FNanchor_310"
href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> that Periklês
sacrificed the landed proprietors of Attica to the maritime interests
and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[p. 178]</span> empire of
Athens. This is of course founded on the destructive invasions of the
country during the Peloponnesian war; for down to the commencement
of that war the position of Attic cultivators and proprietors was
particularly enviable: and the censure of M. Boeckh, therefore,
depends upon the question, how far Periklês contributed to produce,
or had it in his power to avert, this melancholy war, in its results
so fatal, not merely to Athens, but to the entire Grecian race. Now
here again, if we follow attentively the narrative of Thucydidês, we
shall see that in the judgment of that historian, not only Periklês
did not bring on the war, but he could not have averted it without
such concession as Athenian prudence, as well as Athenian patriotism
peremptorily forbade: moreover, we shall see, that the calculations
on which Periklês grounded his hopes of success if driven to war,
were, in the opinion of the historian, perfectly sound and safe.
We may even go farther, and affirm, that the administration of
Periklês during the fourteen years preceding the war, exhibits a
“moderation,” to use the words of Thucydidês,<a id="FNanchor_311"
href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> dictated especially
by anxiety to avoid raising causes of war; though in the months
immediately preceding the breaking out of the war, after the conduct
of the Corinthians at Potidæa, and the resolutions of the congress at
Sparta, he resisted strenuously all compliance with special demands
from Sparta,—demands essentially insincere, and in which partial
compliance would have lowered the dignity of Athens without insuring
peace. The stories about Pheidias, Aspasia, and the Megarians,
even if we should grant that there is some truth at the bottom of
them, must, if we follow Thucydidês, be looked upon at worst as
concomitants and pretexts, rather than as real causes, of the war:
though modern authors, in speaking of Periklês, are but too apt
to use expressions which tacitly assume these stories to be well
founded.</p>

<p>Seeing then that Periklês did not bring on and could not have
averted the Peloponnesian war,—that he steered his course in
reference to that event with the long-sighted prudence of one<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[p. 179]</span> who knew that
the safety and the dignity of imperial Athens were essentially
interwoven,—we have no right to throw upon him the blame of
sacrificing the landed proprietors of Attica. These might, indeed, be
excused for complaining, where they suffered so ruinously; but the
impartial historian, looking at the whole of the case, cannot admit
their complaints as a ground for censuring the Athenian statesman.</p>

<p>The relation of Athens to her allies, the weak point of her
position, it was beyond the power of Periklês seriously to amend,
probably also beyond his will, since the idea of political
incorporation, as well as that of providing a common and equal
confederate bond, sustained by effective federal authority
between different cities, was rarely entertained even by the
best Greek minds.<a id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312"
class="fnanchor">[312]</a> We hear that he tried to summon at
Athens a congress of deputies from all cities of Greece, the allies
of Athens included;<a id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313"
class="fnanchor">[313]</a> but the scheme could not be brought to
bear, in consequence of the reluctance, noway surprising, of the
Peloponnesians. Practically, the allies were not badly treated during
his administration: and if, among the other bad consequences of the
prolonged war, they, as well as Athens, and all other Greeks come to
suffer more and more, this depends upon causes with which he is not
chargeable, and upon proceedings which departed altogether from his
wise and sober calculations. Taking him altogether, with his powers
of thought, speech, and action,—his competence, civil and military,
in the council as well as in the field,—his vigorous and cultivated
intellect, and his comprehensive ideas of a community in pacific and
many-sided development,—his incorruptible public morality, caution,
and firmness, in a country where all those qualities were rare, and
the union of them in the same individual of course much rarer,—we
shall find him without a parallel throughout the whole course of
Grecian history.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[p. 180]</span></p>

<p>Under the great mortality and pressure of sickness at Athens,
their operations of war naturally languished; while the enemies
also, though more active, had but little success. A fleet of one
hundred triremes, with one thousand hoplites on board, was sent by
the Lacedæmonians under Knêmus to attack Zakynthus, but accomplished
nothing beyond devastation of the open parts of the island, and then
returned home. And it was shortly after this, towards the month of
September, that the Ambrakiots made an attack upon the Amphilochian
town called Argos, situated on the southern coast of the gulf of
Ambrakia: which town, as has been recounted in the preceding chapter,
had been wrested from them two years before by the Athenians, under
Phormio, and restored to the Amphilochians and Akarnanians. The
Ambrakiots, as colonists and allies of Corinth, were at the same time
animated by active enmity to the Athenian influence in Akarnania,
and by desire to regain the lost town of Argos. Procuring aid from
the Chaonians, and some other Epirotic tribes, they marched against
Argos, and after laying waste the territory, endeavored to take
the town by assault, but were repulsed, and obliged to retire.<a
id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a>
This expedition appears to have impressed the Athenians with the
necessity of a standing force to protect their interest in those
parts; so that in the autumn Phormio was sent with a squadron
of twenty triremes to occupy Naupaktus, now inhabited by the
Messenians, as a permanent naval station, and to watch the entrance
of the Corinthian gulf.<a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315"
class="fnanchor">[315]</a> We shall find in the events of the
succeeding year ample confirmation of this necessity.</p>

<p>Though the Peloponnesians were too inferior in maritime force
to undertake formal war at sea against Athens, their single
privateers, especially the Megarian privateers from the harbor of
Nisæa, were active in injuring her commerce,<a id="FNanchor_316"
href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a>—and not merely the
commerce of Athens, but also that of other neutral Greeks, without
scruple or discrimination. Several merchantmen and fishing-vessels,
with a considerable number of prisoners, were thus captured.<a
id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a>
Such prisoners as fell into the hands of the Lacedæ<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[p. 181]</span>monians,—even neutral
Greeks as well as Athenians,—were all put to death, and their bodies
cast into clefts of the mountains. In regard to the neutrals, this
capture was piratical, and the slaughter unwarrantably cruel, judged
even by the received practice of the Greeks, deficient as that was
on the score of humanity: but to dismiss these neutral prisoners, or
to sell them as slaves, would have given publicity to a piratical
capture and provoked the neutral towns, so that the prisoners were
probably slain as the best way of getting rid of them and thus
suppressing evidence.<a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318"
class="fnanchor">[318]</a></p>

<p>Some of these Peloponnesian privateers ranged as far as the
southwestern coast of Asia Minor, where they found temporary
shelter, and interrupted the trading-vessels from Phasêlis and
Phenicia to Athens; to protect which, the Athenians despatched,
in the course of the autumn, a squadron of six triremes under
Melêsander. He was farther directed to insure the collection of
the ordinary tribute from Athenian subject-allies, and probably to
raise such contributions as he could elsewhere. In the prosecution
of this latter duty, he undertook an expedition from the sea-coast
against one of the Lykian towns in the interior, but his attack
was repelled with loss, and he himself slain.<a id="FNanchor_319"
href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a></p>

<p>An opportunity soon offered itself to the Athenians, of
retaliating on Sparta for this cruel treatment of the maritime
prisoners. In execution of the idea projected at the commencement of
the war, the Lacedæmonians sent Anêristus and two others as envoys
to Persia, for the purpose of soliciting from the Great King aids of
money and troops against Athens; the dissensions among the Greeks
thus gradually paving the way for him to<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_182">[p. 182]</span> regain his ascendency in the Ægean.
Timagoras of Tegea, together with an Argeian named Pollis, without
any formal mission from his city, and the Corinthian Aristeus,
accompanied them. As the sea was in the power of Athens, they
travelled overland through Thrace to the Hellespont; and Aristeus,
eager to leave nothing untried for the relief of Potidæa, prevailed
upon them to make application to Sitalkês, king of the Odrysian
Thracians. That prince was then in alliance with Athens, and his son
Sadokus had even received the grant of Athenian citizenship: yet the
envoys thought it possible not only to detach him from the Athenian
alliance, but even to obtain from him an army to act against the
Athenians and raise the blockade of Potidæa,—this being refused,
they lastly applied to him for a safe escort to the banks of the
Hellespont, in their way towards Persia. But Learchus and Ameiniadês,
then Athenian residents near the person of Sitalkês, had influence
enough not only to cause rejection of these requests, but also to
induce Sadokus, as a testimony of zeal in his new character of
Athenian citizen, to assist them in seizing the persons of Aristeus
and his companions in their journey through Thrace. Accordingly, the
whole party were seized and conducted as prisoners to Athens, where
they were forthwith put to death, without trial or permission to
speak,—and their bodies cast into rocky chasms, as a reprisal for
the captured seamen slain by the Lacedæmonians.<a id="FNanchor_320"
href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[p. 183]</span></p>
<p>Such revenge against Aristeus, the instigator of the revolt
of Potidæa, relieved the Athenians from a dangerous enemy; and
that blockaded city was now left to its fate. About midwinter it
capitulated, after a blockade of two years, and after going through
the extreme of suffering from famine, to such a degree that some
of those who died were even eaten by the survivors. In spite of
such intolerable distress, the Athenian generals, Xenophon son of
Euripidês and his two colleagues, admitted them to favorable terms
of capitulation,—permitting the whole population and the Corinthian
allies to retire freely, with a specified sum of money per head, as
well as with one garment for each man and two for each woman,—so
that they found shelter among the Chalkidic townships in the
neighborhood. These terms were singularly favorable, considering the
desperate state of the city, which must very soon have surrendered
at discretion: but the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[p.
184]</span> hardships, even of the army without, in the cold of
winter, were very severe, and they had become thoroughly tired both
of the duration and the expense of the siege. The cost to Athens had
been not less than two thousand talents; since the assailant force
had never been lower than three thousand hoplites, during the entire
two years of the siege, and for a portion of the time considerably
greater,—each hoplite receiving two drachmas <i>per diem</i>. The
Athenians at home, when they learned the terms of the capitulation,
were displeased with the generals for the indulgence shown,—since
a little additional patience would have constrained the city to
surrender at discretion: in which case the expense would have been
partly made good by selling the prisoners as slaves,—and Athenian
vengeance probably gratified by putting the warriors to death.<a
id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a>
A body of one thousand colonists were sent from Athens to
occupy Potidæa and its vacant territory.<a id="FNanchor_322"
href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a></p>

<p>Two full years had now elapsed since the actual commencement of
war, by the attack of the Thebans on Platæa; yet the Peloponnesians
had accomplished nothing of what they expected. They had not rescued
Potidæa, nor had their twice-repeated invasion, although assisted by
the unexpected disasters arising from the epidemic, as yet brought
Athens to any sufficient humiliation,—though perhaps the envoys
which she had sent during the foregoing summer with propositions
for peace, contrary to the advice of Periklês, may have produced
an impression that she could not hold out long. At the same time,
the Peloponnesian allies had on their side suffered little damage,
since the ravages inflicted by the Athenian fleet on their coast
may have been nearly compensated by the booty which their invading
troops gained in Attica. Probably by this time the public opinion
in Greece had contracted an unhappy familiarity with the state of
war, so that nothing but some decisive loss and humiliation on one
side at least, if not on both, would suffice to terminate it. In
this third spring, the Peloponnesians did not repeat their annual
march into Attica,—deterred, partly, we may sup<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_185">[p. 185]</span>pose, by fear of the epidemic yet raging
there,—but still more by the strong desire of the Thebans to take
their revenge on Platæa.</p>

<p>To this ill-fated city, Archidamus marched forthwith, at the
head of the confederate army. But no sooner had he entered and
begun to lay waste the territory, than the Platæan heralds came
forth to arrest his hand, and accosted him in the following terms:
“Archidamus, and ye men of Lacedæmon, ye act wrong, and in a manner
neither worthy of yourselves nor of your fathers, in thus invading
the territory of Platæa. For the Lacedæmonian Pausanias, son of
Kleombrotus, after he had liberated Greece from the Persians, in
conjunction with those Greeks who stood forward to bear their
share of the danger, offered sacrifice to Zeus Eleutherius, in
the market-place of Platæa; and there, in presence of all the
allies, assigned to the Platæans their own city and territory to
hold in full autonomy, so that none should invade them wrongfully,
or with a view to enslave them: should such invasion occur, the
allies present pledged themselves to stand forward with all their
force as protectors. While your fathers made to us this grant,
in consideration of our valor and forwardness in that perilous
emergency, ye are now doing the precise contrary: ye are come along
with our worst enemies, the Thebans, to enslave us. And we on our
side now adjure you, calling to witness the gods who sanctioned that
oath, as well as your paternal and our local gods, not to violate
the oath by doing wrong to the Platæan territory, but to let us live
on in that autonomy which Pausanias guaranteed.”<a id="FNanchor_323"
href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a></p>

<p>Whereunto Archidamus replied: “Ye speak fairly, men of Platæa, if
your conduct shall be in harmony with your words. Remain autonomous
yourselves, as Pausanias granted, and help us to liberate those other
Greeks, who, after having shared in the same dangers and sworn the
same oath along with you, have now been enslaved by the Athenians.
It is for their liberation and that of the other Greeks that this
formidable outfit of war has been brought forth. Pursuant to your
oaths, ye ought by rights, and we now invite you, to take active
part in this object. But if ye cannot act thus, at least remain
quiet, conformably to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[p.
186]</span> summons which we have already sent to you; enjoy your own
territory, and remain neutral,—receiving both parties as friends,
but neither party for warlike purposes. With this we shall be
satisfied.”</p>

<p>The reply of Archidamus discloses by allusion a circumstance
which the historian had not before directly mentioned; that
the Lacedæmonians had sent a formal summons to the Platæans to
renounce their alliance with Athens and remain neutral: at what
time this took place,<a id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324"
class="fnanchor">[324]</a> we do not know, but it marks the peculiar
sentiment attaching to the town. But the Platæans did not comply with
the invitation thus twice repeated. The heralds, having returned for
instructions into the city, brought back for answer, that compliance
was impossible, without the consent of the Athenians, since their
wives and families were now harbored at Athens: besides, if they
should profess neutrality, and admit both parties as friends, the
Thebans might again make an attempt to surprise their city. In reply
to their scruples, Archidamus again addressed them: “Well, then,
hand over your city and houses to us Lacedæmonians: mark out the
boundaries of your territory: specify the number of your fruit-trees,
and all your other property which admits of being numbered; and then
retire whithersoever ye choose, as long as the war continues. As soon
as it is over, we will restore to you all that we have received,—in
the interim, we will hold it in trust, and keep it in cultivation,
and pay you such an allowance as shall suffice for your wants.”<a
id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a></p>

<p>The proposition now made was so fair and tempting, that the
general body of the Platæans were at first inclined to accept
it, provided the Athenians would acquiesce; and they obtained
from Archidamus a truce long enough to enable them to send envoys
to Athens. After communication with the Athenian assembly, the
envoys returned to Platæa, bearing the following answer: “Men of
Platæa, the Athenians say they have never yet permitted you to be
wronged since the alliance first began,—nor will they now betray
you, but will help you to the best of their<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_187">[p. 187]</span> power. And they adjure you, by the
oaths which your fathers swore to them, not to depart in any way from
the alliance.”</p>

<p>This message awakened in the bosoms of the Platæans the full
force of ancient and tenacious sentiment. They resolved to maintain,
at all cost, and even to the extreme of ruin, if necessity should
require it, their union with Athens. It was indeed impossible that
they could do otherwise, considering the position of their wives and
families, without the consent of the Athenians; and though we cannot
wonder that the latter refused consent, we may yet remark, that, in
their situation, a perfectly generous ally might well have granted
it. For the forces of Platæa counted for little as a portion of
the aggregate strength of Athens; nor could the Athenians possibly
protect it against the superior land-force of their enemies,—in fact,
so hopeless was the attempt that they never even tried, throughout
the whole course of the long subsequent blockade.</p>

<p>The final refusal of the Platæans was proclaimed to Archidamus, by
word of mouth from the walls, since it was not thought safe to send
out any messenger. As soon as the Spartan prince heard the answer,
he prepared for hostile operations,—apparently with very sincere
reluctance, attested in the following invocation, emphatically
pronounced:—</p>

<p>“Ye gods and heroes, who hold the Platæan territory, be ye my
witnesses, that we have not in the first instance wrongfully—not
until these Platæans have first renounced the oaths binding on all of
us—invaded this territory, in which our fathers defeated the Persians
after prayers to you, and which ye granted as propitious for Greeks
to fight in,—nor shall we commit wrong in what we may do farther, for
we have taken pains to tender reasonable terms, but without success.
Be ye now consenting parties: may those who are beginning the wrong
receive punishment for it,—may those who are aiming to inflict
penalty righteously, obtain their object.”</p>

<p>It was thus that Archidamus, in language delivered probably
under the walls, and within hearing of the citizens who manned
them, endeavored to conciliate the gods and heroes of that town
which he was about to ruin and depopulate. The whole of this
preliminary debate,<a id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326"
class="fnanchor">[326]</a> so strikingly and dramatically set forth
by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[p. 188]</span> Thucydidês,
illustrates forcibly the respectful reluctance with which the
Lacedæmonians first brought themselves to assail this scene of
the glories of their fathers. What deserves remark is, that their
direct sentiment attaches itself, not at all to the Platæan people,
but only to the Platæan territory; it is purely local, though it
becomes partially transferred to the people, as tenants of this
spot, by secondary association. It was, however, nothing but the
long-standing antipathy<a id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327"
class="fnanchor">[327]</a> of the Thebans which induced Archidamus to
undertake the enterprise; for the conquest of Platæa was of no avail
towards the main objects of the war, though its exposed situation
caused it to be crushed between the two great contending forces in
Greece.</p>

<p>Archidamus now commenced the siege forthwith, in full hopes
that his numerous army, the entire strength of the Peloponnesian
confederacy, would soon capture a place of no great size, and
probably not very well fortified; yet defended by a resolute garrison
of four hundred native citizens, with eighty Athenians: there was no
one else in the town except one hundred and ten female slaves for
cooking. The fruit-trees, cut down in laying waste the cultivated
land, sufficed to form a strong palisade all round the town, so as
completely to block up the inhabitants. Next, Archidamus, having
abundance of timber near at hand in the forests of Kithæron, began to
erect a mound up against a portion of the town wall, so as to be able
to march up by an inclined plane, and thus take the place by assault.
Wood, stones, and earth, were piled up in a vast heap,—cross palings
of wood being carried on each side of it, in parallel lines at right
angles to the town wall, for the purpose of keeping the loose mass of
materials between them together. For seventy days and as many nights
did the army labor at this work, without any intermission, taking
turns for food and repose: and through such unremitting assiduity,
the mound approached near to the height of the town wall. But as it
gradually mounted up, the Platæans were not idle on their side: they
constructed an additional wall of wood, which they planted on the
top of their own town wall, so as to heighten the part over against
the enemy’s mound: sustaining it by brickwork behind, for which the
neigh<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[p. 189]</span>boring
houses furnished materials: hides, raw as well as dressed, were
suspended in front of it, in order to protect their workmen
against missiles, and the woodwork against fire-carrying arrows.<a
id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> And
as the besiegers still continued heaping up materials, to carry their
mound up to the height even of this recent addition, the Platæans
met them by breaking a hole in the lower part of their town wall,
and pulling in the earth from the lower portion of the mound; which
thus gave way at the top and left a vacant space near the wall, until
the besiegers filled it up by letting down quantities of stiff clay
rolled up in wattled reeds, which could not be pulled away in the
same manner. Again, the Platæans dug a subterranean passage from the
interior of their town to the ground immediately under the mound, and
thus carried away unseen the lower earth belonging to the latter;
so that the besiegers saw their mound continually sinking down, in
spite of fresh additions at the top,—yet without knowing the reason.
Nevertheless, it was plain that these stratagems would be in the end
ineffectual, and the Platæans accordingly built a new portion of
town wall in the interior, in the shape of a crescent, taking its
start from the old town wall on each side of the mound: the besiegers
were thus deprived of all benefit from the mound, assuming it to
be successfully completed; since when they had marched over it,
there stood in front of them a new town wall to be carried in like
manner.</p>

<p>Nor was this the only method of attack employed. Archidamus
farther brought up battering engines, one of which greatly shook
and endangered the additional height of wall built by the Platæans
over against the mound; while others were brought to bear on
different portions of the circuit of the town wall. Against these
new assailants, various means of defence were used: the defenders on
the walls threw down ropes, got hold of the head of the approaching
engine, and pulled it by main force out of the right line, either
upwards or sideways: or they prepared heavy wooden beams on the
wall, each attached to both ends by long iron chains to two poles
projecting at right angles from the wall, by means of which poles it
was raised up and held aloft: so that at the proper moment, when the
battering machine approached<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[p.
190]</span> the wall, the chain was suddenly let go, and the beam
fell down with great violence directly upon the engine and broke
off its projecting beak.<a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329"
class="fnanchor">[329]</a> However rude these defensive processes
may seem, they were found effective against the besiegers, who saw
themselves, at the close of three months’ unavailing efforts, obliged
to renounce the idea of taking the town in any other way than by the
process of blockade and famine,—a process alike tedious and costly.<a
id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a></p>

<p>Before they would incur so much inconvenience, however, they
had recourse to one farther stratagem,—that of trying to set the
town on fire. From the height of their mound, they threw down large
quantities of fagots, partly into the space between the mound and
the newly-built crescent piece of wall,—partly, as far as they could
reach, into other parts of the city: pitch and other combustibles
were next added, and the whole mass set on fire. The conflagration
was tremendous, such as had never been before seen: a large portion
of the town became unapproachable, and the whole of it narrowly
escaped destruction. Nothing could have preserved it, had the wind
been rather more favorable: there was indeed a farther story, of
a most opportune thunder-storm coming to extinguish the flames,
which Thucydidês does not seem to credit.<a id="FNanchor_331"
href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> In spite of much
partial damage, the town remained still defensible, and the spirit of
the inhabitants unsubdued.</p>

<p>There now remained no other resource except to build a wall
of circumvallation round Platæa, and trust to the slow process
of famine. The task was distributed in suitable fractions among
the various confederate cities, and completed about the middle of
September, a little before the autumnal equinox.<a id="FNanchor_332"
href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> Two dis<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[p. 191]</span>tinct walls were
constructed, with sixteen feet of intermediate space all covered in,
so as to look like one very thick wall: there were, moreover, two
ditches, out of which the bricks for the wall had been taken,—one
on the inside towards Platæa, and the other on the outside against
any foreign relieving force. The interior covered space between the
walls was intended to serve as permanent quarters for the troops left
on guard, consisting half of Bœotians and half of Peloponnesians.<a
id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a></p>

<p>At the same time that Archidamus began the siege of Platæa, the
Athenians on their side despatched a force of two thousand hoplites
and two hundred horsemen, to the Chalkidic peninsula, under Xenophon
son of Euripidês (with two colleagues), the same who had granted so
recently the capitulation of Potidæa. It was necessary doubtless,
to convoy and establish the new colonists who were about to occupy
the deserted site of Potidæa: moreover, the general had acquired
some knowledge of the position and parties of the Chalkidic towns,
and hoped to be able to act against them with effect. They first
invaded the territory belonging to the Bottiæan town of Spartôlus,
not without hopes that the city itself would be betrayed to them
by intelligences within: but this was prevented by the arrival
of an additional force from Olynthus, partly hoplites, partly
peltasts. These peltasts, a species of troops between heavy-armed
and light-armed, furnished with a pelta (or light shield), and short
spear, or javelin, appear to have taken their rise among these
Chalkidic Greeks, being equipped in a manner half Greek and half
Thracian: we shall find them hereafter much improved and turned
to account by some of the ablest Grecian generals. The Chalkidic
hoplites are generally of inferior merit: on the other hand, their
cavalry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[p. 192]</span> and their
peltasts are very good: in the action which now took place under
the walls of Spartôlus, the Athenian hoplites defeated those of the
enemy, but their cavalry and their light troops were completely
worsted by the Chalkidic. These latter, still farther strengthened
by the arrival of fresh peltasts from Olynthus, ventured even
to attack the Athenian hoplites, who thought it prudent to fall
back upon the two companies left in reserve to guard the baggage.
During this retreat they were harassed by the Chalkidic horse and
light-armed, who retired when the Athenians turned upon them, but
attacked them on all sides when on their march; and employed missiles
so effectively that the retreating hoplites could no longer maintain
a steady order, but took to flight, and sought refuge at Potidæa.
Four hundred and thirty hoplites, near one-fourth of the whole force,
together with all three generals, perished in this defeat, and the
expedition returned in dishonor to Athens.<a id="FNanchor_334"
href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a></p>

<p>In the western parts of Greece, the arms of Athens and her
allies were more successful. The repulse of the Ambrakiots from the
Amphilochian Argos, during the preceding year, had only exasperated
them and induced them to conceive still larger plans of aggression
against both the Akarnanians and Athenians. In concert with their
mother-city Corinth, where they obtained warm support, they prevailed
upon the Lacedæmonians to take part in a simultaneous attack of
Akarnania, by land as well as by sea, which would prevent the
Akarnanians from concentrating their forces in any one point, and put
each of their townships upon an isolated self-defence; so that all
of them might be overpowered in succession, and detached, together
with Kephallênia and Zakynthus, from the Athenian alliance. The
fleet of Phormio at Naupaktus, consisting only of twenty triremes,
was accounted incompetent to cope with a Peloponnesian fleet such as
might be fitted out at Corinth. There was even some hope that the
important station at Naupaktus might itself be taken, so as to expel
the Athenians completely from those parts.</p>

<p>The scheme of operations now projected was far more comprehensive
than anything which the war had yet afforded. The land-force of the
Ambrakiots, together with their neighbors and<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_193">[p. 193]</span> fellow-colonists the Leukadians and
Anaktorians, assembled near their own city, while their maritime
force was collected at Leukas, on the Akarnanian coast. The force at
Ambrakia was joined, not only by Knêmus, the Lacedæmonian admiral,
with one thousand Peloponnesian hoplites, who found means to cross
over from Peloponnesus, eluding the vigilance of Phormio,—but also
by a numerous body of Epirotic and Macedonian auxiliaries, collected
even from the distant and northernmost tribes. A thousand Chaonians
were present, under the command of Photyus and Nikanor, two annual
chiefs chosen from the regal gens. Neither this tribe, nor the
Thesprotians who came along with them, acknowledged any hereditary
king. The Molossians and Atintânes, who also joined the force, were
under Sabylinthus, regent on behalf of the young prince Tharypas.
There came, besides, the Paranæi, from the banks of the river Aôus
under their king Orœdus, together with one thousand Orestæ, a tribe
rather Macedonian than Epirot, sent by their king Antiochus. Even
king Perdikkas, though then nominally in alliance with Athens, sent
one thousand of his Macedonian subjects, who, however, arrived too
late to be of any use.<a id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335"
class="fnanchor">[335]</a> This large and diverse body of Epirotic
invaders, a new phenomenon in Grecian history, and got together
doubtless by the hopes of plunder, proves the extensive relations of
the tribes of the interior with the city of Ambrakia,—a city destined
to become in later days the capital of the Epirotic king Pyrrhus.</p>

<p>It had been concerted that the Peloponnesian fleet from Corinth
should join that already assembled at Leukas, and act upon the coast
of Akarnania at the same time that the land-force marched into that
territory. But Knêmus finding the land-force united and ready, near
Ambrakia, deemed it unnecessary to await the fleet from Corinth,
and marched straight into Akarnania, through Limnæa, a frontier
village territory belonging to the Amphilochian Argos. He directed
his march upon Stratus,—an interior town, and the chief place in
Akarnania,—the capture of which would be likely to carry with it the
surrender of the rest; especially as the Akarnanians, distracted by
the presence of the ships at Leukas, and alarmed by the large body
of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[p. 194]</span> invaders on
their frontier, did not dare to leave their own separate homes,
so that Stratus was left altogether to its own citizens. Nor was
Phormio, though they sent an urgent message to him, in any condition
to help them; since he could not leave Naupaktus unguarded, when the
large fleet from Corinth was known to be approaching. Under such
circumstances, Knêmus and his army indulged the most confident hopes
of overpowering Stratus without difficulty. They marched in three
divisions: the Epirots in the centre,—the Leukadians and Anaktorians
on the right,—the Peloponnesians and Ambrakiots, together with
Knêmus himself, on the left. So little expectation was entertained
of resistance, that these three divisions took no pains to keep near
or even in sight of each other. Both the Greek divisions, indeed,
maintained a good order of march, and kept proper scouts on the look
out; but the Epirots advanced without any care or order whatever;
especially the Chaonians, who formed the van. These men, accounted
the most warlike of all the Epirotic tribes, were so full of conceit
and rashness, that when they approached near to Stratus, they would
not halt to encamp and assail the place conjointly with the Greeks;
but marched along with the other Epirots right forward to the town,
intending to attack it single-handed, and confident that they should
carry it at the first assault, before the Greeks came up, so that
the entire glory would be theirs. The Stratians watched and profited
by this imprudence. Planting ambuscades in convenient places, and
suffering the Epirots to approach without suspicion near to the
gates, they then suddenly sallied out and attacked them, while the
troops in ambuscade rose up and assailed them at the same time. The
Chaonians who formed the van, thus completely surprised, were routed
with great slaughter; while the other Epirots fled, after but little
resistance. So much had they hurried forward in advance of their
Greek allies, that neither the right nor the left division were at
all aware of the battle, until the flying barbarians, hotly pursued
by the Akarnanians, made it known to them. The two divisions then
joined, protected the fugitives, and restrained farther pursuit,—the
Stratians declining to come to hand-combat with them until the
other Akarnanians should arrive. They seriously annoyed the forces
of Knêmus, however, by distant slinging, in which the Akarnanians
were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[p. 195]</span> preëminently
skilful; nor did Knêmus choose to persist in his attack under such
discouraging circumstances. As soon as night arrived, so that there
was no longer any fear of slingers, he retreated to the river Anapus,
a distance of between nine and ten miles. Well aware that the news
of the victory would attract other Akarnanian forces immediately
to the aid of Stratus, he took advantage of the arrival of his own
Akarnanian allies from Œniadæ (the only town in the country which
was attached to the Lacedæmonian interest), and sought shelter
near their city. From thence his troops dispersed, and returned to
their respective homes.<a id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336"
class="fnanchor">[336]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Peloponnesian fleet from Corinth, which had been
destined to coöperate with Knêmus off the coast of Akarnania, had
found difficulties in its passage, alike unexpected and insuperable.
Mustering forty-seven triremes of Corinth, Sikyon, and other
places, with a body of soldiers on board, and with accompanying
store-vessels,—it departed from the harbor of Corinth, and made its
way along the northern coast of Achaia. Its commanders, not intending
to meddle with Phormio and his twenty ships at Naupaktus, never
for a moment imagined that he would venture to attack a number so
greatly superior: the triremes were, accordingly, fitted out more
as transports for numerous soldiers than with any view to naval
combat,—and with little attention to the choice of skilful rowers.<a
id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a></p>

<p>Except in the combat near Korkyra, and there only partially,
the Peloponnesians had never yet made actual trial of Athenian
maritime efficiency, at the point of excellence which it had now
reached: themselves retaining the old unimproved mode of fighting
and of working ships at sea, they had no practical idea of the
degree to which it had been superseded by Athenian training. Among
the Athenians, on the contrary, not only the seamen generally had a
confirmed feeling of their own superiority,—but Phormio especially,
the ablest of all their captains, always familiarized his men with
the conviction, that no Peloponnesian fleet,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_196">[p. 196]</span> be its number ever so great, could
possibly contend against them with success.<a id="FNanchor_338"
href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> Accordingly, the
Corinthian admirals, Machaon and his two colleagues, were surprised
to observe that Phormio with his small Athenian squadron, instead of
keeping safe in Naupaktus, was moving in parallel line with them and
watching their progress until they should get out of the Corinthian
gulf into the more open sea. Having advanced along the northern coast
of Peloponnesus as far as Patræ in Achaia, they then altered their
course, and bore to the northwest in order to cross over towards the
Ætolian coast, in their way to Akarnania. In doing this, however,
they perceived that Phormio was bearing down upon them from Chalkis
and the mouth of the river Euenus, and they now discovered for the
first time that he was going to attack them. Disconcerted by this
incident, and not inclined for a naval combat in the wide and open
sea, they altered their plan of passage, returned to the coast of
Peloponnesus, and brought to for the night at some point near to
Rhium, the narrowest breadth of the strait. Their bringing to was a
mere feint intended to deceive Phormio, and induce him to go back
for the night to his own coast: for, during the course of the night,
they left their station, and tried to get across the breadth of the
gulf, where it was near the strait, and comparatively narrow, before
Phormio could come down upon them: and if the Athenian captain had
really gone back to take night-station on his own coast, they would
probably have got across to the Ætolian or northern coast without
any molestation in the wide sea: but he watched their movements
closely, kept the sea all night, and was thus enabled to attack
them in mid-channel, even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[p.
197]</span> during the shorter passage near the strait, at the
first dawn of morning.<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339"
class="fnanchor">[339]</a> On seeing his approach, the Corinthian
admirals<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[p. 198]</span>
ranged their triremes in a circle with the prows outward, like the
spokes of a wheel; the circle was made as large as it could<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[p. 199]</span> be without leaving
opportunity to the Athenian assailing ships to practise the
manœuvre of the diekplus,<a id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340"
class="fnanchor">[340]</a> and the interior space was sufficient,
not merely for the store-vessels, but also for five chosen triremes,
who were kept as a reserve, to dart out when required through the
intervals between the outer triremes.</p>

<p>In this position they were found and attacked shortly after
daybreak, by Phormio, who bore down upon them with his ships in
single file, all admirable sailors, and his own ship leading; all
being strictly forbidden to attack until he should give the signal.
He rowed swiftly round the Peloponnesian circle, nearing the prows
of their ships as closely as he could, and making constant semblance
of being about to come to blows. Partly from the intimidating effect
of this manœuvre, altogether novel to the Peloponnesians,—partly
from the natural difficulty, well known to Phormio, of keeping every
ship in its exact stationary position,—the order of the circle, both
within and without, presently became disturbed. It was not long
before a new ally came to his aid, on which he fully calculated,
postponing his actual attack until this favorable incident occurred.
The strong land-breeze out of the gulf of Corinth, always wont to
begin shortly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[p. 200]</span>
after daybreak, came down upon the Peloponnesian fleet with its
usual vehemence, at a moment when the steadiness of their order was
already somewhat giving way, and forced their ships more than ever
out of proper relation one to the other. The triremes began to run
foul of each other, or become entangled with the store-vessels: so
that in every ship the men aboard were obliged to keep pushing off
their neighbors on each side with poles,—not without loud clamor and
mutual reproaches, which prevented both the orders of the captain,
and the cheering sound or song whereby the keleustês animated the
rowers and kept them to time, from being at all audible. Moreover,
the fresh breeze had occasioned such a swell, that these rowers,
unskilful under all circumstances, could not get their oars clear of
the water, and the pilots thus lost all command over their vessels.<a
id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a>
The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[p. 201]</span> critical
moment was now come, and Phormio gave the signal for attack. He first
drove against and disabled one of the admiral’s ships,—his comrades
next assailed others with equal success,—so that the Peloponnesians,
confounded and terrified, attempted hardly any resistance, but broke
their order and sought safety in flight. They fled partly to Patræ,
partly to Dymê, in Achaia, pursued by the Athenians; who, with
scarcely the loss of a man, captured twelve triremes, took aboard and
carried away almost the entire crews, and sailed off with them to
Molykreium, or Antirrhium, the northern cape at the narrow mouth of
the Corinthian gulf, opposite to the corresponding cape called Rhium
in Achaia. Having erected at Antirrhium a trophy for the victory,
dedicating one of the captive triremes to Poseidon, they returned
to Naupaktus; while the Peloponnesian ships sailed along the shore
from Patræ to Kyllênê, the principal port in the territory<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[p. 202]</span> of Elis. They were
here soon afterwards joined by Knêmus, who passed over with his
squadron from Leukas.<a id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342"
class="fnanchor">[342]</a></p>

<p>These two incidents, just recounted, with their details,—the
repulse of Knêmus and his army from Stratus, and the defeat of the
Peloponnesian fleet by Phormio,—afford ground for some interesting
remarks. The first of the two displays the great inferiority of the
Epirots to the Greeks,—and even to the less advanced portion of the
Greeks,—in the qualities of order, discipline, steadiness, and power
of coöperation for a joint purpose. Confidence of success with them
is exaggerated into childish rashness, so that they despise even the
commonest precautions either in march or attack; while the Greek
divisions on their right and on their left are never so elate as to
omit either. If, on land, we thus discover the inherent superiority
of Greeks over Epirots involuntarily breaking out,—so in the
sea-fight we are no less impressed with the astonishing superiority
of the Athenians over their opponents; a superiority, indeed, noway
inherent, such as that of Greeks over Epirots, but depending in
this case on previous toil, training, and inventive talent, on the
one side, compared with neglect and old-fashioned routine on the
other. Nowhere does the extraordinary value of that seamanship,
which the Athenians had been gaining by years of improved practice,
stand so clearly marked as in these first battles of Phormio. It
gradually becomes less conspicuous as we advance in the war, since
the Peloponnesians improve, learning seamanship as the Russians,
under Peter the Great, learned the art of war from the Swedes, under
Charles the Twelfth,—while the Athenian triremes and their crews
seem to become less choice and effective, even before the terrible
disaster at Syracuse, and are irreparably deteriorated after that
misfortune.</p>

<p>To none did the circumstances of this memorable sea-fight seem
so incomprehensible as to the Lacedæmonians. They had heard,
indeed, of the seamanship of Athens, but had never felt it, and
could not understand what it meant: so they imputed the defeat to
nothing but disgraceful cowardice, and sent indignant orders to
Knêmus at Kyllênê, to take the command, equip a larger and better
fleet, and repair the dishonor. Three Spartan<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_203">[p. 203]</span> commissioners—Brasidas, Timokratês,
and Lykophron—were sent down to assist him with their advice and
exertions in calling together naval contingents from the different
allied cities: and by this means, under the general resentment
occasioned by the recent defeat, a large fleet of seventy-seven
triremes was speedily mustered at Panormus,—a harbor of Achaia near
to the promontory of Rhium, and immediately within the interior
gulf. A land-force was also collected at the same place ashore, to
aid the operations of the fleet. Such preparations did not escape
the vigilance of Phormio, who transmitted to Athens news of his
victory, at the same time urgently soliciting reinforcements to
contend with the increasing strength of the enemy. The Athenians
immediately sent twenty fresh ships to join him: but they were
induced by the instances of a Kretan named Nikias, their proxenus
at Gortyn, to allow him to take the ships first to Krete, on the
faith of his promise to reduce the hostile town of Kydonia. He
had made this promise as a private favor to the inhabitants of
Polichna, border enemies of Kydonia; but when the fleet arrived he
was unable to fulfil it: nothing was effected except ravage of the
Kydonian lands, and the fleet was long prevented by adverse winds and
weather from getting away.<a id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343"
class="fnanchor">[343]</a> This ill-advised diversion of the fleet
from its straight course to join Phormio is a proof how much the
counsels of Athens were beginning to suffer from the loss of
Periklês, who was just now in his last illness and died shortly
afterwards. That liability to be seduced by novel enterprises
and projects of acquisition, against which he so emphatically
warned his countrymen,<a id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344"
class="fnanchor">[344]</a> was even now beginning to manifest its
disastrous consequences.</p>

<p>Through the loss of this precious interval, Phormio now found
himself, with no more than his original twenty triremes, opposed to
the vastly increased forces of the enemy,—seventy-seven triremes,
with a large force on land to back them: the latter, no mean help
in ancient warfare. He took up his station<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_204">[p. 204]</span> near the Cape Antirrhium, or the
Molykric Rhium, as it was called,—the opposite cape to the Achaic
Rhium: the line between them, seemingly about an English mile in
breadth, forms the entrance of the Corinthian gulf. The Messenian
force from Naupaktus attended him, and served on land. But he kept
on the outside of the gulf, anxious to fight in a large and open
breadth of sea, which was essential to Athenian manœuvring: while his
adversaries on their side remained on the inside of the Achaic cape,
from the corresponding reason,—feeling that to them the narrow sea
was advantageous, as making the naval battle like to a land battle,
effacing all superiority of nautical skill.<a id="FNanchor_345"
href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> If we revert back to
the occasion of the battle of Salamis, we find that narrowness of
space was at that time accounted the best of all protections for a
smaller fleet against a larger. But such had been the complete change
of feeling, occasioned by the system of manœuvring introduced since
that period in the Athenian navy, that amplitude of sea room is now
not less coveted by Phormio than dreaded by his enemies. The improved
practice of Athens had introduced a revolution in naval warfare.</p>

<p>For six or seven days successively, the two fleets were drawn out
against each other,—Phormio trying to entice the Peloponnesians to
the outside of the gulf, while they on their side did what they could
to bring him within it.<a id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346"
class="fnanchor">[346]</a> To him, every day’s postponement was
gain, since it gave him a new chance of his reinforcements arriving:
for that very reason, the Peloponnesian commanders were eager to
accelerate an action, and at length resorted to a well-laid plan for
forcing it on. But in spite of immense numerical superiority, such
was the discouragement and reluctance, prevailing among their seamen,
many of whom had been actual sufferers in the recent defeat,—that
Knêmus and Brasidas had to employ emphatic exhortations; insisting
on the favorable prospect before them,—pointing out that the late
battle had been lost only by mismanagement and imprudence, which
would be for the future corrected,—and appealing to the inherent
bravery of the Peloponnesian warrior. They concluded by a hint, that
while those who behaved well in the coming battle would receive due
honor, the laggards would assuredly be pun<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_205">[p. 205]</span>ished:<a id="FNanchor_347"
href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> a topic rarely
touched upon by ancient generals in their harangues on the eve of
battle, and demonstrating conspicuously the reluctance of many of
the Peloponnesian seamen, who had been brought to the fight again
chiefly by the ascendency and strenuous commands of Sparta. To this
reluctance Phormio pointedly alluded, in the encouraging exhortations
which he on his side addressed to his men: for they too, in spite of
their habitual confidence at sea, strengthened by the recent victory,
were dispirited by the smallness of their numbers. He reminded them
of their long practice and rational conviction of superiority at
sea, such as no augmentation of numbers, especially with an enemy
conscious of his own weakness, could overbalance: and he called
upon them to show their habitual discipline and quick apprehension
of orders, and above all to perform their regular movements in
perfect silence during the actual battle,<a id="FNanchor_348"
href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a>—useful in all matters
of war, and essential to the proper conduct of a sea-fight. The idea
of entire silence on board the Athenian ships while a sea-fight was
going on, is not only striking as a feature in the picture, but is
also one of the most powerful evidences of the force of self-control
and military habits among these citizen-seamen.</p>

<p>The habitual position of the Peloponnesian fleet off Panormus was
within the strait, but nearly fronting the breadth of it,—opposite
to Phormio, who lay on the outer side of the strait, as well as
off the opposite cape: in the Peloponnesian line, therefore, the
right wing occupied the north, or northeast side towards Naupaktus.
Knêmus and Brasidas now resolved to make a forward movement up
the gulf, as if against that town, which was the main Athenian
station; for they knew that Phormio would be under the necessity
of coming to the defence of the place, and they hoped to pin him
up and force him to action close under the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_206">[p. 206]</span> land, where Athenian manœuvring would
be unavailing. Accordingly, they commenced this movement early in
the morning, sailing in line of four abreast towards the northern
coast of the inner gulf; the right squadron, under the Lacedæmonian
Timokratês, was in the van, according to its natural position,<a
id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> and
care had been taken to place in it twenty of the best sailing ships,
since the success of the plan of action was known beforehand to
depend upon their celerity. As they had foreseen, Phormio the moment
he saw their movement, put his men on shipboard, and rowed into the
interior of the strait, though with the greatest reluctance; for the
Messenians were on land alongside of him, and he knew that Naupaktus,
with their wives and families, and a long circuit of wall,<a
id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a>
was utterly undefended. He ranged his ships in line of battle ahead,
probably his own the leading ship; and sailed close along the land
towards Naupaktus, while the Messenians marching ashore kept near to
him. Both fleets were thus moving in the same direction, and towards
the same point, the Athenian close along shore, the Peloponnesians
somewhat farther off.<a id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351"
class="fnanchor">[351]</a> The latter had now got Phormio into
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[p. 207]</span> position
which they wished, pinned up against the land, with no room
for tactics. On a sudden the signal was given, and the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[p. 208]</span> whole Peloponnesian
fleet facing to the left, changed from column into line, and instead
of continuing to sail along the coast, rowed<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_209">[p. 209]</span> rapidly with their prows shore-ward to
come to close quarters with the Athenians. The right squadron of the
Peloponnesians<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[p. 210]</span>
occupying the side towards Naupaktus, was especially charged with the
duty of cutting off the Athenians from all possibility of escaping
thither; and the best ships had been placed on the right for that
important object. As far as the commanders were concerned, the
plan of action completely succeeded; the Athenians were caught in
a situation where resistance was impossible, and had no chance of
escape except in flight. But so superior were they in rapid movement
even to the best Peloponnesians, that eleven ships, the headmost
out of the twenty, just found means to run by,<a id="FNanchor_352"
href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> before the right
wing of the enemy closed in upon the shore; and made the best of
their way to Naupaktus. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[p.
211]</span> remaining nine ships were caught and driven ashore with
serious damage,—their crews being partly slain, partly escaping by
swimming. The Peloponnesians towed off one trireme with its entire
crew, and some others empty; but more than one of them was rescued
by the bravery of the Messenian hoplites, who, in spite of their
heavy panoply, rushed into the water and got aboard them, fighting
from the decks and driving off the enemy even after the rope had been
actually made fast, and the process of dragging off had begun.<a
id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a></p>

<p>The victory of the Peloponnesians seemed assured, and while their
left and centre were thus occupied, the twenty ships of their right
wing parted company with the rest, in order to pursue the eleven
fugitive Athenian ships which they had failed in cutting off. Ten of
these got clear away into the harbor of Naupaktus, and there posted
themselves in an attitude of defence near the temple of Apollo,
before any of the pursuers could come near; while the eleventh,
somewhat less swift, was neared by the Lacedæmonian admiral; who,
on board a Leukadian trireme, pushed greatly ahead of his comrades,
in hopes of overtaking at least this one prey. There happened to
lie moored a merchant vessel, at the entrance of the harbor of
Naupaktus; and the Athenian captain in his flight, observing that the
Leukadian pursuer was for the moment alone, seized the opportunity
for a bold and rapid manœuvre. He pulled swiftly round the merchant
vessel, directed his trireme so as to meet the advancing Leukadian,
and drove his beak against her midships with an impact so violent
as to disable her at once; her commander, the Lacedæmonian admiral,
Timokratês, was so stung with anguish at this unexpected catastrophe,
that he slew himself forthwith, and fell overboard into the harbor.
The pursuing vessels coming up behind, too, were so astounded and
dismayed by it, that the men, dropping their oars, held water, and
ceased to advance; while some even found themselves half aground,
from ignorance of the coast. On the other hand, the ten Athenian
triremes in the harbor were beyond measure elated by the incident,
so that a single word from Phormio sufficed to put them in active
forward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[p. 212]</span> motion,
and to make them strenuously attack the embarrassed enemy: whose
ships, disordered by the heat of pursuit, and having been just
suddenly stopped, could not be speedily got again under way, and
expected nothing less than renewed attack. First, the Athenians
broke the twenty pursuing ships, on the right wing; next, they
pursued their advantage against the left and centre, who had probably
neared to the right; so that after a short resistance, the whole
were completely routed, and fled across the gulf to their original
station at Panormus.<a id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354"
class="fnanchor">[354]</a> Not only did the eleven Athenian ships
thus break, terrify, and drive away the entire fleet of the enemy,
with the capture of six of the nearest Peloponnesian triremes,—but
they also rescued those ships of their own which had been driven
ashore and taken in the early part of the action: moreover, the
Peloponnesian crews sustained a considerable loss, both in killed and
in prisoners.</p>

<p>Thus, in spite not only of the prodigious disparity of numbers,
but also of the disastrous blow which the Athenians had sustained at
first, Phormio ended by gaining a complete victory; a victory, to
which even the Lacedæmonians were forced to bear testimony, since
they were obliged to ask a truce for burying and collecting their
dead, while the Athenians on their part picked up the bodies of their
own warriors. The defeated party, however, still thought themselves
entitled, in token of their success in the early part of the action,
to erect a trophy on the Rhium of Achaia, where they also dedicated
the single Athenian trireme which they had been able to carry
off. Yet they were so com<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[p.
213]</span>pletely discomfited,—and farther, so much in fear of the
expected reinforcement from Athens,—that they took advantage of the
night to retire, and sail into the gulf to Corinth: all except the
Leukadians, who returned to their own home.</p>

<p>Nor was it long before the reinforcement actually arrived, after
that untoward detention which had wellnigh exposed Phormio and his
whole fleet to ruin. It confirmed his mastery of the entrance of
the gulf and of the coast of Akarnania, where the Peloponnesians
had now no naval force at all. To establish more fully the Athenian
influence in Akarnania, he undertook during the course of the
autumn an expedition, landing at Astakus, and marching into the
Akarnanian inland country with four hundred Athenian hoplites and
four hundred Messenians. Some of the leading men of Stratus and
Koronta, who were attached to the Peloponnesian interest, he caused
to be sent into exile, while the chief named Kynês, of Koronta,
who seems to have been hitherto in exile, was reëstablished in his
native town. The great object was, to besiege and take the powerful
town of Œniadæ, near the mouth of the Achelôus; a town at variance
with the other Akarnanians, and attached to the Peloponnesians. But
the great spread of the waters of the Achelôus rendered this siege
impracticable during the winter, and Phormio returned to the station
at Naupaktus. From hence he departed to Athens towards the end of the
winter, carrying home both his prize-ships and such of his prisoners
as were freemen. The latter were exchanged man for man against
Athenian prisoners in the hands of Sparta.<a id="FNanchor_355"
href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a></p>

<p>After abandoning the naval contest at Rhium, and retiring to
Corinth, Knêmus and Brasidas were prevailed upon by the Megarians,
before the fleet dispersed, to try the bold experiment of a sudden
inroad upon Peiræus. Such was the confessed superiority of the
Athenians at sea, that, while they guarded amply the coasts of
Attica against privateers, they never imagined the possibility of
an attack upon their own main harbor. Accordingly, Peiræus was not
only unprotected by any chain across the entrance, but destitute
even of any regular guard-ships manned and ready. The seamen of
the retiring Pelopon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[p.
214]</span>nesian armament, on reaching Corinth, were immediately
disembarked and marched, first across the isthmus, next to
Megara,—each man carrying his sitting-cloth,<a id="FNanchor_356"
href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> and his oar, together
with the loop whereby the oar was fastened to the oar-hole in the
side, and thus prevented from slipping. There lay forty triremes in
Nisæa, the harbor of Megara, which, though old and out of condition,
were sufficient for so short a trip; and the seamen immediately
on arriving, launched these and got aboard. But such was the awe
entertained of Athens and her power, that when the scheme came
really to be executed, the courage of the Peloponnesians failed,
though there was nothing to hinder them from actually reaching
Peiræus: but it was pretended that the wind was adverse, and they
contented themselves with passing across to the station of Budorum,
in the opposite Athenian island of Salamis, where they surprised and
seized the three guard-ships which habitually blockaded the harbor
of Megara, and then landed upon the island. They spread themselves
over a large part of Salamis, ravaged the properties, and seized
men as well as goods. Fire-signals immediately made known this
unforeseen aggression, both at Peiræus and at Athens, occasioning
in both the extreme of astonishment and alarm; for the citizens
in Athens, not conceiving distinctly the meaning of the signals,
fancied that Peiræus itself had fallen into the hands of the enemy.
The whole population rushed down to the Peiræus at break of day, and
put to sea with all the triremes that were<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_215">[p. 215]</span> ready against the Peloponnesians; but
these latter, aware of the danger which menaced them, made haste to
quit Salamis with their booty, and the three captured guard-ships.
The lesson was salutary to the Athenians: from henceforward Peiræus
was furnished with a chain across the mouth, and a regular guard,
down to the end of the war.<a id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357"
class="fnanchor">[357]</a> Forty years afterwards, however, we shall
find it just as negligently watched, and surprised with much more
boldness and dexterity, by the Lacedæmonian captain Teleutias.<a
id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a></p>

<p>As during the summer of this year, the Ambrakiots had brought down
a numerous host of Epirotic tribes to the invasion of Akarnania,
in conjunction with the Peloponnesians,—so during the autumn, the
Athenians obtained aid against the Chalkidians of Thrace from a
still more powerful barbaric prince, Sitalkês, king of the Odrysian
Thracians. Amidst the numerous tribes, between the Danube and the
Ægean sea,—who all bore the generic name of Thracians, though
each had a special name besides,—the Odrysians were at this time
the most warlike and powerful. The Odrysian king Têrês, father of
Sitalkês, had made use of this power to subdue<a id="FNanchor_359"
href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> and render tributary
a great number of these different tribes, especially those whose
residence was in the plain rather than in the mountains. His
dominion, the largest existing between the Ionian sea and the
Euxine, extended from Abdêra, or the mouth of the Nestus, in the
Ægean sea, to the mouth of the Danube in the Euxine; though it
seems that this must be understood with deductions, since many
intervening tribes, especially mountain tribes, did not acknowledge
his authority. Sitalkês himself had invaded and conquered some of
the Pæonian tribes who joined the Thracians on the west, between
the Axius and the Strymon.<a id="FNanchor_360" href="#Footnote_360"
class="fnanchor">[360]</a> Dominion, in the sense of the Odrysian
king, meant tribute, presents, and military force when required; and
with the two former, at least, we may conclude that he was amply
supplied, since his nephew and successor Seuthes, under whom the
revenue increased and attained its maximum, received four hundred
talents annually in gold and silver as tribute, and the like sum in
various presents, over and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[p.
216]</span> above many other presents of manufactured articles
and ornaments. These latter came from the Grecian colonies on the
coast, which contributed moreover largely to the tribute, though
in what proportions we are not informed: even Grecian cities not
in Thrace sent presents to forward their trading objects, as
purchasers for the produce, the plunder, and the slaves, acquired by
Thracian chiefs or tribes.<a id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361"
class="fnanchor">[361]</a> The residence of the Odrysians properly so
called, and of the princes of that tribe now ruling over so many of
the remaining tribes, appears to have been about twelve days’ journey
inland from Byzantium,<a id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362"
class="fnanchor">[362]</a> in the upper regions of the Hebrus and
Strymon, south of Mount Hæmus, and northeast of Rhodopê. The Odrysian
chiefs were connected by relationship more or less distant with those
of the subordinate tribes, and by marriage even with the Scythian
princes north of the Danube: the Scythian prince Ariapeithês<a
id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> had
married the daughter of the Odrysian Têrês, the first who extended
the dominion of his tribe over any considerable portion of Thrace.</p>

<p>The natural state of the Thracian tribes—in the judgment
of Herodotus, permanent and incorrigible—was that of disunion
and incapacity of political association; were such association
possible, he says, they would be strong enough to vanquish every
other nation,—though Thucydidês considers them as far inferior to
the Scythians. The Odrysian dominion had probably not reached, at
the period when Herodotus made his inquiries, the same development
which Thucydidês describes in the third year of the Peloponnesian
war, and which imparted to these tribes an union, partial indeed
and temporary, but such as they never reached either before or
afterwards. It has been already mentioned that the Odrysian prince
Sitalkês, had taken for his wife, or rather for one of his wives,
the sister of Nymphodôrus, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[p.
217]</span> Greek, of Abdêra; by whose mediation he had been made
the ally, and his son Sadokus even a citizen, of Athens,—and had
been induced to promise that he would reconquer the Chalkidians
of Thrace for the benefit of the Athenians,<a id="FNanchor_364"
href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a>—his ancient kinsmen,
according to the mythe of Tereus as interpreted by both parties.
At the same time, Perdikkas, king of Macedonia, had offended him
by refusing to perform a promise made of giving him his sister in
marriage,—a promise made as consideration for the interference of
Sitalkês and Nymphodôrus in procuring for him peace with Athens,
at a moment when he was much embarrassed by civil dissensions with
his brother Philip. The latter prince, ruling in his own name, and
seemingly independent of Perdikkas, over a portion of the Macedonians
along the upper course of the Axius, had been expelled by his
more powerful brother, and taken refuge with Sitalkês: he was now
apparently dead, but his son Amyntas received from the Odrysian
prince the promise of restoration. The Athenians had ambassadors
resident with Sitalkês, and they sent Agnon as special envoy to
concert arrangements for his march against the Chalkidians, with
which an Athenian armament was destined to coöperate. In treating
with Sitalkês, it was necessary to be liberal in presents, both to
himself and to the subordinate chieftains who held power dependent
upon him: nothing could be accomplished among the Thracians except
by the aid of bribes,<a id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365"
class="fnanchor">[365]</a> and the Athenians were more<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[p. 218]</span> competent to supply
this exigency than any other people in Greece. The joint expedition
against the Chalkidians was finally resolved.</p>

<p>But the forces of Sitalkês, collected from many different
portions of Thrace, were tardy in coming together. He summoned all
the tribes under his dominion, between Hæmus, Rhodopê, and the two
seas: the Getæ, between Mount Hæmus and the Danube, equipped like the
Scythians, their neighbors on the other side of the river, with bow
and arrow on horseback, also joined him, as well as the Agrianes,
the Lææi, and the other Pæonian tribes subject to his dominion;
lastly, several of the Thracian tribes called Dii, distinguished by
their peculiar short swords, and maintaining a fierce independence
on the heights of Rhodopê, were tempted by the chance of plunder,
or the offer of pay, to flock to his standard. Altogether, his
army amounted, or was supposed to amount, to one hundred and fifty
thousand men, one third of it cavalry, who were for the most part
Getæ and Odrysians proper. The most formidable warriors in his camp
were the independent tribes of Rhodopê; but the whole host, alike
numerous, warlike, predatory, and cruel, spread terror amidst all
those who were within even the remote possibilities of its march.</p>

<p>Starting from the central Odrysian territory, and bringing with
him Agnon and the other Athenian envoys, he first crossed the
uninhabited mountain called Kerkinê, which divided the Pæonians
on the west from the Thracian tribes called Sinti and Mædi on the
east, until he reached the Pæonian town or district called<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[p. 219]</span> Dobêrus;<a
id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a>
it was here that many troops and additional volunteers reached him,
making up his full total. From Dobêrus, probably marching down
along one of the tributary streams of the Axius, he entered into
that portion of Upper Macedonia, which lies along the higher Axius,
and which had constituted the separate principality of Philip:
the presence in his army of Amyntos son of Philip, induced some
of the fortified places, Gortynia, Atalantê, and others, to open
their gates without resistance, while Eidomenê was taken by storm,
and Eurôpus in vain attacked. From hence, he passed still farther
southward into Lower Macedonia, the kingdom of Perdikkas; ravaging
the territory on both sides of the Axius even to the neighborhood of
the towns Pella and Kyrrhus; and apparently down as far south as the
mouth of the river and the head of the Thermaic gulf. Farther south
than this he did not go, but spread his force over the districts
between the left bank of the Axius and the head of the Strymonic
gulf,—Mygdonia, Krestônia, and Anthemus,—while a portion of his
army was detached to overrun the territory of the Chalkidians and
Bottiæans. The Macedonians under Perdikkas, renouncing all idea of
contending on foot against so overwhelming a host, either fled or
shut themselves up in the small number of fortified places which
the country presented. The cavalry from Upper Macedonia, indeed,
well armed and excellent, made some orderly and successful charges
against the Thracians, lightly armed with javelins, short swords, and
the pelta, or small shield,—but it was presently shut in, harassed
on all sides by superior numbers, and compelled to think only of
retreat and extrication.<a id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367"
class="fnanchor">[367]</a></p>

<p>Luckily for the enemies of the Odrysian king, his march was not
made until the beginning of winter, seemingly about November or
December. We may be sure that the Athenians,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_220">[p. 220]</span> when they concerted with him the joint
attack upon the Chalkidians, intended that it should be in a better
time of the year: having probably waited to hear that his army was
in motion, and waited long in vain, they began to despair of his
coming at all, and thought it not worth while to despatch any force
of their own to the spot.<a id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368"
class="fnanchor">[368]</a> Some envoys and presents only were
sent as compliments, instead of the coöperating armament; and
this disappointment, coupled with the severity of the weather,
the nakedness of the country, and the privations of his army at
that season, induced Sitalkês soon to enter into negotiations with
Perdikkas; who, moreover, gained over Seuthes, nephew of the Odrysian
prince, by promising his sister Stratonikê in marriage, together
with a sum of money, on condition that the Thracian host should be
speedily withdrawn. This was accordingly done, after it had been
distributed for thirty days over Macedonia: during eight of those
days his detachment had ravaged the Chalkidic lands. But the interval
had been quite long enough to diffuse terror all around: such a
host of fierce barbarians had never before been brought together,
and no one knew in what direction they might be disposed to carry
their incursions. The independent Thracian tribes (Panæi, Odomantê,
Drôi, and Dersæi) in the plains on the northeast of the Strymon, and
near Mount Pangæus, not far from Amphipolis, were the first to feel
alarm lest Sitalkês should take the opportunity of trying to conquer
them; on the other side, the Thessalians, Magnêtes, and other Greeks
north of Thermopylæ, anticipated that he would carry his invasion
farther south, and began to organize means for resisting him: even
the general Peloponnesian confederacy heard with uneasiness of this
new ally whom Athens was bringing into the field, perhaps against
them. All such alarms were dissipated, when Sitalkês, after remaining
thirty days, returned by the way he came, and the formidable
avalanche was thus seen to melt away without falling on them.
The faithless Perdikkas, on this occasion, performed his promise
to Seuthes, having drawn upon himself much mischief by violating
his previous similar promise to Sitalkês.<a id="FNanchor_369"

<p class="ti0"><span class="smcap">The</span> second and third years
of the war had both been years of great suffering with the Athenians,
from the continuance of the epidemic, which did not materially relax
until the winter of the third year (<small>B.C.</small> 429-428).
It is no wonder that, under the pressure of such a calamity, their
military efforts were enfeebled, although the victories of Phormio
had placed their maritime reputation at a higher point than ever. To
their enemies, the destructive effects of this epidemic—effects still
felt, although the disorder itself was suspended during the fourth
year of the war—afforded material assistance as well as encouragement
to persevere; and the Peloponnesians, under Archidamus, again
repeated during this year their invasion and ravage of Attica, which
had been intermitted during the year preceding. As before, they met
with no serious resistance: entering the country about the beginning
of May, they continued the process of devastation until their
provisions were exhausted.<a id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370"
class="fnanchor">[370]</a> To this damage the Athenians had probably
now accustomed themselves: but they speedily received, even while
the invaders were in their country, intelligence of an event far
more embarrassing and formidable,—the revolt of Mitylênê and of the
greater part of Lesbos.</p>

<p>This revolt, indeed, did not come even upon the Athenians wholly
unawares; but the idea of it was of longer standing than they
suspected, for the Mitylenæan oligarchy had projected it before
the war, and had made secret application to Sparta for aid, but
without success. Some time after hostilities broke out, they resumed
the design, which was warmly promoted by the Bœotians, kinsmen of
the Lesbians in Æolic lineage and dialect. The Mitylenæan leaders
appear to have finally determined on revolt<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_222">[p. 222]</span> during the preceding autumn or winter;
but they thought it prudent to make ample preparations before they
declared themselves openly: and, moreover, they took measures
for constraining three other towns in Lesbos—Antissa, Eresus,
and Pyrrha—to share their fortunes, to merge their own separate
governments, and to become incorporated with Mitylênê. Methymna,
the second town in Lesbos, situated on the north of the island, was
decidedly opposed to them and attached to Athens. The Mitylenæans
built new ships, put their walls in an improved state of defence,
carried out a mole in order to narrow the entrance of their harbor,
and render it capable of being closed with a chain, despatched
emissaries to hire Scythian bowmen and purchase corn in the Euxine,
and took such other measures as were necessary for an effective
resistance. Though the oligarchical character of their government
gave them much means of secrecy, and above all, dispensed with the
necessity of consulting the people beforehand,—still, measures of
such importance could not be taken without provoking attention.
Intimation was sent to the Athenians by various Mitylenæan citizens,
partly from private feeling, partly in their capacity of <i>proxeni</i>
(or <i>consuls</i>, to use a modern word which approaches to the meaning)
for Athens,—especially by a Mitylenæan named Doxander, incensed with
the government for having disappointed his two sons of a marriage
with two orphan heiresses.<a id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371"
class="fnanchor">[371]</a> Not less communicative were the islanders
of Tenedos, animated by ancient neighborly jealousy towards Mitylênê;
so that the Athenians were thus forewarned both of the intrigues
between Mitylênê and the Spartans and of her certain impending
revolt unless they immediately interfered.<a id="FNanchor_372"
href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[p. 223]</span></p>

<p>This news seems to have become certain about February or March 428
<small>B.C.</small>: but such was then the dispirited
condition of the Athenians,—arising from two years’ suffering
under the epidemic, and no longer counteracted by the wholesome
remonstrances of Periklês,—that they could not at first bring
themselves to believe what they were so much afraid to find true.
Lesbos, like Chios, was their ally, upon an equal footing, still
remaining under those conditions which had been at first common
to all the members of the confederacy of Delos. Mitylênê paid no
tribute to Athens: it retained its walls, its large naval force, and
its extensive landed possessions on the opposite Asiatic continent:
its government was oligarchical, administering all internal affairs
without the least reference to Athens. Its obligations as an ally
were, that, in case of war, it was held bound to furnish armed ships,
whether in determinate number or not, we do not know: it would
undoubtedly be restrained from making war upon Tenedos, or any other
subject-ally of Athens: and its government or its citizens would
probably be held liable to answer before the Athenian dikasteries, in
case of any complaint of injury from the government or citizens of
Tenedos or of any other ally of Athens,—these latter being themselves
also accountable before the same tribunals, under like complaints
from Mitylênê. That city was thus in practice all but independent,
and so extremely powerful that the Athenians in their actual state
of depression were fearful of coping with it, and therefore loth
to believe the alarming intelligence which reached them. They sent
envoys with a friendly message to persuade the Mitylenæans to suspend
their proceedings, and it was only when these envoys returned without
success that they saw the necessity of stronger measures. Ten
Mitylenæan triremes, serving as contingent in the Athenian fleet,
were seized, and their crews placed under guard; while Kleïppidês,
then on the point of starting, along with two colleagues, to
conduct a fleet of forty triremes round Peloponnesus, was directed
to alter his destination and to proceed forthwith to Mitylênê.<a
id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a>
It was expected that he would reach that town about the time
of the approaching festival of Apollo Maloeis, celebrated in
its neighborhood,—on which occasion the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_224">[p. 224]</span> whole Mitylenæan population was in the
habit of going forth to the temple: so that the town, while thus
deserted, might easily be surprised and seized by the fleet. In case
this calculation should be disappointed, Kleïppidês was instructed to
require that the Mitylenæans should surrender their ships of war and
raze their fortifications, and, in case of refusal, to attack them
immediately.</p>

<p>But the publicity of debate at Athens was far too great to
allow such a scheme to succeed. The Mitylenæans had their spies
in the city, and the moment the resolution was taken, one of them
set off to communicate it at Mitylênê. Crossing over to Geræstus
in Eubœa, he got aboard a merchantman on the point of departure,
and reached Mitylênê with a favorable wind on the third day from
Athens: so that when Kleïppidês arrived shortly afterwards, he found
the festival adjourned and the government prepared for him. The
requisition which he sent in was refused, and the Mitylenæan fleet
even came forth from the harbor to assail him, but was beaten back
with little difficulty: upon which, the Mitylenæan leaders, finding
themselves attacked before their preparations were completed, and
desiring still to gain time before they declared their revolt,
opened negotiations with Kleïppidês, and prevailed on him to suspend
hostilities until ambassadors could be sent to Athens,—protesting
that they had no serious intention of revolting. This appears to
have been about the middle of May, soon after the Lacedæmonian
invasion of Attica. Kleïppidês was induced, not very prudently, to
admit this proposition, under the impression that his armament was
insufficient to cope with a city and island so powerful; and he
remained moored off the harbor at the north of Mitylênê until the
envoys, among whom was included one of the very citizens of Mitylênê
who had sent to betray the intended revolt, but who had since changed
his opinion, should return from Athens. Meanwhile the Mitylenæan
government, unknown to Kleïppidês, and well aware that the embassy
would prove fruitless, took advantage of the truce to send secret
envoys to Sparta, imploring immediate aid: and on the arrival of
the Lacedæmonian Meleas and the Theban Hermæondas, who had been
despatched to Mitylênê earlier, but had only come in by stealth since
the arrival of Kleïppidês, a second trireme was sent along with them,
carrying additional envoys to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[p.
225]</span> reiterate the solicitation. These arrivals and despatches
were carried on without the knowledge of the Athenian admiral,
chiefly in consequence of the peculiar site of the town, which had
originally been placed upon a little islet divided from Lesbos by
a narrow channel, or <i>euripus</i>, and had subsequently been extended
across into the main island,—like Syracuse, and so many other Grecian
settlements. It had consequently two harbors, one north, the other
south of the town: Kleïppidês was anchored off the former, but the
latter remained unguarded.<a id="FNanchor_374" href="#Footnote_374"
class="fnanchor">[374]</a></p>

<p>During the absence of the Mitylenæan envoys at Athens,
reinforcements reached the Athenian admiral from Lemnos, Imbros, and
some other allies, as well as from the Lesbian town of Methymna:
so that when the envoys returned, as they presently did, with
an unfavorable reply, war was resumed with increased vigor. The
Mitylenæans, having made a general sally with their full military
force, gained some advantage in the battle; yet, not feeling bold
enough to maintain the field, they retreated back behind their
walls. The news of their revolt, when first spread abroad, had
created an impression unfavorable to the stability of the Athenian
empire: but when it was seen that their conduct was irresolute,
and their achievements disproportionate to their supposed power,
a reaction of feeling took place,—and the Chians and other allies
came in with increased zeal in obedience to the summons of Athens
for reinforcements. Kleïppidês soon found his armament large enough
to establish two separate camps, markets for provision, and naval
stations, north and south of the town, so as to watch and block up
both the harbors at once.<a id="FNanchor_375" href="#Footnote_375"
class="fnanchor">[375]</a> But he commanded little beyond the area
of his camp, and was unable to invest the city by land; especially
as the Mitylenæans had received reinforcements from An<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[p. 226]</span>tissa, Pyrrha, and
Eresus, the other towns of Lesbos which acted with them. They were
even sufficiently strong to march against Methymna, in hopes that it
would be betrayed to them by a party within; but this expectation
was not realized, nor could they do more than strengthen the
fortifications, and confirm the Mitylenæan supremacy, in the other
three subordinate towns; in such manner that the Methymnæans, who
soon afterwards attacked Antissa, were repulsed with considerable
loss. In this undecided condition the island continued, until,
somewhere about the month of August <small>B.C.</small>
428, the Athenians sent Pachês to take the command, with a
reinforcement of one thousand hoplites, who rowed themselves thither
in triremes. The Athenians were now in force enough not only to keep
the Mitylenæans within their walls, but also to surround the city
with a single wall of circumvallation, strengthened by separate forts
in suitable positions. By the beginning of October, Mitylênê was thus
completely blockaded, by land as well as by sea.<a id="FNanchor_376"
href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Mitylenæan envoys, after a troublesome voyage,
reached Sparta a little before the Olympic festival, about the
middle of June. The Spartans directed them to come to Olympia
at the festival, where all the members of the Peloponnesian
confederacy would naturally be present,—and there to set forth their
requests, after the festival was concluded, in presence of all.<a
id="FNanchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a>
Thucydidês has given us, at some length, his version of the speech
wherein this was done,—a speech not a little remarkable. Pronounced
as it was by men who had just revolted from Athens, having the
strongest interest to raise indignation against her as well as
sympathy for themselves,—and before an audience exclusively composed
of the enemies of Athens, all willing to hear, and none present to
refute, the bitterest calumnies against her, we should have expected
a confident sense of righteous and well-grounded though perilous
effort on the part of the Mitylenæans, and a plausible collection
of wrongs and oppressions alleged against the common enemy. Instead
of which, the speech is apologetic and embarrassed: the speaker not
only does not allege any extortion or severe dealing from Athens
towards the Mitylenæans, but even admits the fact that they had
been treated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[p. 227]</span>
by her with marked honor;<a id="FNanchor_378" href="#Footnote_378"
class="fnanchor">[378]</a> and that, too, during a long period of
peace, during which she stood less in awe of her allies generally,
and would have had much more facility in realizing any harsh
purposes towards them, than she could possibly enjoy now that the
war had broken out, when their discontents would be likely to find
powerful protectors.<a id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379"
class="fnanchor">[379]</a> According to his own showing, the
Mitylenæans, while they had been perfectly well treated by Athens
during the past, had now acquired, by the mere fact of war, increased
security for continuance of the like treatment during the future. It
is upon this ground of security for the future, nevertheless, that
he rests the justification of the revolt, not pretending to have
any subject of positive complaint. The Mitylenæans, he contends,
could have no prospective security against Athens: for she had
successively and systematically brought into slavery all her allies,
except Lesbos and Chios, though all had originally been upon an
equal footing: and there was every reason for fearing that she would
take the first convenient opportunity of reducing the two last
remaining to the same level,—the rather as their position was now
one of privilege and exception, offensive to her imperial pride and
exaggerated ascendency. It had hitherto suited the policy of Athens
to leave these two exceptions, as a proof that the other allies
had justly incurred their fate, since otherwise Lesbos and Chios,
having equal votes, would not have joined forces in reducing them:<a
id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a>
but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[p. 228]</span> this policy
was now no longer necessary, and the Mitylenæans, feeling themselves
free only in name, were imperatively called upon by regard for
their own safety to seize the earliest opportunity for emancipating
themselves in reality. Nor was it merely regard for their own safety,
but a farther impulse of Pan-Hellenic patriotism; a desire to take
rank among the opponents, and not among the auxiliaries of Athens,
in her usurpation of sovereignty over so many free Grecian states.<a
id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> The
Mitylenæans had, however, been compelled to revolt with preparations
only half-completed, and had therefore a double claim upon the succor
of Sparta,—the single hope and protectress of Grecian autonomy. And
Spartan aid—if now lent immediately and heartily, in a renewed attack
on Attica during this same year, by sea as well as by land—could
not fail to put down the common enemy, exhausted as she was by
pestilence as well as by the cost of three years’ war, and occupying
her whole maritime force, either in the siege of Mitylênê or round
Peloponnesus. The orator concluded by appealing not merely to the
Hellenic patriotism and sympathies of the Peloponnesians, but also to
the sacred name of the Olympic Zeus, in whose precinct the meeting
was held, that his pressing entreaty might not be disregarded.<a
id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a></p>

<p>In following this speech of the orator, we see the plain
confession that the Mitylenæans had no reason whatever to complain
of the conduct of Athens towards themselves: she had respected alike
their dignity, their public force, and their private security. This
important fact helps us to explain, first, the indifference which the
Mitylenæan people will be found to manifest in the revolt; next, the
barbarous resolution taken by the Athenians after its suppression.
The reasons given for the revolt are mainly two. 1. The Mitylenæans
had no security that Athens would not degrade them into the condition
of subject-allies like the rest. 2. They did not choose to second
the ambition of Athens, and to become parties to a war, for the sake
of maintaining an empire essentially offensive to Grecian political
instincts. In both these two reasons there is force; and both touch
the sore point of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[p.
229]</span> Athenian empire. That empire undoubtedly contradicted one
of the fundamental instincts of the Greek mind,—the right of every
separate town to administer its own political affairs apart from
external control. The Peloponnesian alliance recognized this autonomy
in theory, by the general synod and equal voting of all the members
at Sparta, on important occasions; though it was quite true,<a
id="FNanchor_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a>
as Periklês urged at Athens, that in practice nothing more was
enjoyed than an autonomy confined by Spartan leading-strings,—and
though Sparta held in permanent custody hostages for the fidelity of
her Arcadian allies, summoning their military contingents without
acquainting them whither they were destined to march. But Athens
proclaimed herself a despot, effacing the autonomy of her allies not
less in theory than in practice: far from being disposed to cultivate
in them any sense of a real common interest with herself, she did not
even cheat them with those forms and fictions which so often appease
discontent in the absence of realities. Doubtless, the nature of
her empire, at once widely extended, maritime, and unconnected, or
only partially connected, with kindred of race, rendered the forms
of periodical deliberation difficult to keep up; at the same time
that it gave to her as naval chief an ascendency much more despotic
than could have been exercised by any chief on land. It is doubtful
whether she could have overcome—it is certain that she did not try
to overcome—these political difficulties; so that her empire stood
confessed as a despotism, opposed to the political instinct of the
Greek mind; and the revolts against it, like this of Mitylênê,—in
so far as they represented a genuine feeling, and were not merely
movements of an oligarchical party against their own democracy,—were
revolts of this offended instinct, much more than consequences of
actual oppression. The Mitylenæans might certainly affirm that
they had no security against being one day reduced to the common
condition of subject-allies like the rest; yet an Athenian speaker,
had he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[p. 230]</span> been here
present, might have made no mean reply to this portion of their
reasoning;—he would have urged that, had Athens felt any dispositions
towards such a scheme, she would have taken advantage of the fourteen
years’ truce to execute it; and he would have shown that the
degradation of the allies by Athens, and the change in her position
from president to despot had been far less intentional and systematic
than the Mitylenæan orator affirmed.</p>

<p>To the Peloponnesian auditors, however, the speech of the latter
proved completely satisfactory; the Lesbians were declared members
of the Peloponnesian alliance, and a second attack upon Attica was
decreed. The Lacedæmonians, foremost in the movement, summoned
contingents from their various allies, and were early in arriving
with their own at the isthmus: they there began to prepare carriages
or trucks for dragging across the isthmus the triremes which had
fought against Phormio, from the harbor of Lechæum into the Saronic
gulf, in order to employ them against Athens. But the remaining
allies did not answer to the summons, remaining at home occupied with
their harvest; and the Lacedæmonians, sufficiently disappointed with
this languor and disobedience, were still farther confounded by the
unexpected presence of one hundred Athenian triremes off the coast of
the isthmus. The Athenians, though their own presence at the Olympic
festival was forbidden by the war, had doubtless learned more or less
thoroughly the proceedings which had taken place there respecting
Mitylênê. Perceiving the general belief entertained of their
depressed and helpless condition, they determined to contradict this
by a great and instant effort, and accordingly manned forthwith one
hundred triremes, requiring the personal service of all men, citizens
as well as metics; and excepting only the two richest classes of the
Solonian census, <i>i. e.</i> the pentakosiomedimni, and the hippeis, or
horsemen. With this prodigious fleet they made a demonstration along
the isthmus in view of the Lacedæmonians, and landed in various
parts of the Peloponnesian coast to inflict damage. At the same
time, thirty other Athenian triremes, despatched sometime previously
to Akarnania, under Asôpius, son of Phormio, landed at different
openings in Laconia, for the same purpose; and this news reached
the Lacedæmonians at the isthmus while the other great Athe<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[p. 231]</span>nian fleet was parading
before their eyes.<a id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384"
class="fnanchor">[384]</a> Amazed at so unexpected a demonstration
of strength, they began to feel how much the Mitylenæans had misled
them respecting the exhaustion of Athens, and how incompetent they
were, especially without the presence of their allies, to undertake
any joint effective movement by sea and land against Attica. They
therefore returned home, resolving to send an expedition of forty
triremes, under Alkidas, to the relief of Mitylênê itself; at the
same time transmitting requisitions to their various allies, in
order that these triremes might be furnished.<a id="FNanchor_385"
href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile, Asôpius, with his thirty triremes, had arrived in
Akarnania, from whence all the ships except twelve were sent home.
He had been nominated commander as the son of Phormio, who appears
either to have died, or to have become unfit for service, since his
victories of the preceding year; and the Akarnanians had preferred
a special request that a son, or at least some relative of Phormio,
should be invested with the command of the squadron; so beloved was
his name and character among them. Asôpius, however, accomplished
nothing of importance, though he again undertook conjointly with
the Akarnanians a fruitless march against Œniadæ. Ultimately, he
was defeated and slain, in attempting a disembarkation on the
territory of Leukas.<a id="FNanchor_386" href="#Footnote_386"
class="fnanchor">[386]</a></p>

<p>The sanguine announcement made by the Mitylenæans at Olympia,
that Athens was rendered helpless by the epidemic, had indeed been
strikingly contradicted by her recent display; since, taking numbers
and equipment together, the maritime force which she had put forth
this summer, manned as it was by a higher class of seamen, surpassed
all former years; although, in point of number only, it was inferior
to the two hundred and fifty triremes which she had sent out during
the first summer of the war.<a id="FNanchor_387" href="#Footnote_387"
class="fnanchor">[387]</a> But the assertion that Athens was
impoverished in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[p. 232]</span>
finances was not so destitute of foundation: for the whole treasure
in the acropolis, six thousand talents at the commencement of the
war, was now consumed, with the exception of that reserve of one
thousand talents which had been solemnly set aside against the last
exigences of defensive resistance. This is not surprising, when we
learn that every hoplite engaged for near two years and a half in
the blockade of Potidæa, received two drachmas per day, one for
himself and a second for an attendant: there were during the whole
time of the blockade three thousand hoplites engaged there,—and for a
considerable portion of the time, four thousand six hundred; besides
the fleet, all the seamen of which received one drachma per day per
man. Accordingly the Athenians were now for the first time obliged
to raise a direct contribution among themselves, to the amount of
two hundred talents, for the purpose of prosecuting the siege of
Mitylênê: and they at the same time despatched Lysiklês with four
colleagues, in command of twelve triremes, to collect money. What
relation these money-gathering ships bore to the regular tribute paid
by the subject-allies, or whether they were allowed to visit these
latter, we do not know: in the present case, Lysiklês landed<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[p. 233]</span> at Myus, near the mouth
of the Mæander, and marched up the country to levy contributions on
the Karian villages in the plain of that river: but he was surprised
by the Karians, perhaps aided by the active Samian exiles at Anæa in
the neighborhood, and slain, with a considerable number of his men.<a
id="FNanchor_388" href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a></p>

<p>While the Athenians thus held Mitylênê under siege, their
faithful friends, the Platæans, had remained closely blockaded
by the Peloponnesians and Bœotians for more than a year,
without any possibility of relief. At length, provisions began
to fail, and the general, Eupompidês, backed by the prophet
Theænetus,—these prophets<a id="FNanchor_389" href="#Footnote_389"
class="fnanchor">[389]</a> were often among the bravest soldiers in
the army,—persuaded the garrison to adopt the daring but seemingly
desperate resolution of breaking out over the blockading wall, and
in spite of its guards. So desperate, indeed, did the project seem,
that at the moment of execution, one half of the garrison shrank from
it as equivalent to certain death: the other half, about two hundred
and twelve in number, persisted and escaped. Happy would it have been
for the remainder had they even perished in the attempt, and thus
forestalled the more melancholy fate in store for them!</p>

<p>It has been already stated, that the circumvallation of Platæa
was accomplished by a double wall and a double ditch, one ditch
without the encircling walls, another between them and the town;
the two walls being sixteen feet apart, joined together, and roofed
all round, so as to look like one thick wall, and to afford covered
quarters for the besiegers. Both the outer and inner circumference
were furnished with battlements, and after every ten battlements
came a roofed tower, covering the whole breadth of the double
wall,—allowing a free passage inside, but none outside. In general,
the entire circuit of the roofed wall was kept under watch night
and day: but on wet nights the besiegers had so far relaxed their
vigilance as to retire under cover of the towers, and leave the
intermediate spaces unguarded: and it was upon this omission that the
plan of escape was founded. The Platæans prepared ladders of a proper
height to scale the block<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[p.
234]</span>ading double wall, ascertaining its height by repeatedly
counting the ranges of bricks, which were quite near enough for them
to discern, and not effectually covered with whitewash. On a cold and
dark December night, amidst rain, sleet, and a roaring wind, they
marched forth from the gates, lightly armed, some few with shields
and spears, but most of them with breastplates, javelins, and bows
and arrows: the right foot was naked, and the left foot alone shod,
so as to give to it a more assured footing on the muddy ground.<a
id="FNanchor_390" href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a>
Taking care to sally out with the wind in their faces, and at such a
distance from each other as to prevent any clattering of arms, they
crossed the inner ditch and reached the foot of the wall without
being discovered: the ladders, borne in the van, were immediately
planted, and Ammeas, son of Korœbus, followed by eleven others, armed
only with a short sword and breastplate, mounted the wall: others,
armed with spears, followed him, their shields being carried and
handed to them when on the top by comrades behind. It was the duty
of this first company to master and maintain the two towers, right
and left, so as to keep the intermediate space free for passing
over. This was successfully done, the guards in both towers being
surprised and slain, without alarming the remaining besiegers:
and many of the Platæans had already reached the top of the wall,
when the noise of a tile accidently knocked down by one of them,
betrayed what was passing. Immediately a general clamor was raised,
alarm was given, and the awakened garrison rushed up from beneath
to the top of the wall, yet not knowing where the enemy was to be
found; a perplexity farther increased by the Platæans in the town,
who took this opportunity of making a false attack on the opposite
side. Amidst such confusion and darkness, the blockading detachment
could not tell where to di<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[p.
235]</span>rect their blows, and all remained at their posts, except
a reserve of three hundred men, kept constantly in readiness for
special emergencies, who marched out and patrolled the outside of
the ditch to intercept any fugitives from within. At the same time,
fire-signals were raised to warn their allies at Thebes,—but here
again the Platæans in the town had foreseen and prepared fire-signals
on their part, which they hoisted forthwith, in order to deprive this
telegraphic communication of all special meaning.<a id="FNanchor_391"
href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile, the escaping Platæans, masters of the two adjoining
towers,—on the top of which some of them mounted, while others
held the doorway through, so as to repel with spears and darts
all approach of the blockaders,—prosecuted their flight without
interruption over the space between, shoving down the battlements in
order to make it more level and plant a greater number of ladders.
In this manner they all successively got over and crossed the
outer ditch; every man, immediately after crossing, standing ready
on the outer bank, with bow and javelin, to repel assailants and
maintain safe passages for his comrades in the rear. At length,
when all had descended, there remained the last and greatest
difficulty,—the escape of those who occupied the two towers and kept
the intermediate portion of wall free: yet even this was accomplished
successfully and without loss. The outer ditch was, however, found
embarrassing,—so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[p. 236]</span>
full of water from the rain as to be hardly fordable, yet with
thin ice on it also, from a previous frost: for the storm, which
in other respects was the main help to their escape, here retarded
their passage of the ditch by an unusual accumulation of water. It
was not, however, until all had crossed except the defenders of the
towers,—who were yet descending and scrambling through,—that the
Peloponnesian reserve of three hundred were seen approaching the spot
with torches. Their unshielded right side was turned towards the
ditch, and the Platæans, already across and standing on the bank,
immediately assailed them with arrows and javelins,—in which the
torches enabled them to take tolerable aim, while the Peloponnesians
on their side could not distinguish their enemies in the dark, and
had no previous knowledge of their position. They were thus held in
check until the rearmost Platæans had surmounted the difficulties
of the passage: after which the whole body stole off as speedily as
they could, taking at first the road towards Thebes, while their
pursuers were seen with their torch-lights following the opposite
direction, on the road which led by the heights called Dryos-Kephalæ
to Athens: after having marched about three quarters of a mile on
the road to Thebes, leaving the chapel of the Hero Androkratês on
their right hand, the fugitives quitted it, and striking to the
eastward towards Erythræ and Hysiæ, soon found themselves in safety
among the mountains which separate Bœotia from Attica at that point;
from whence they passed into the glad harbor and refuge of Athens.<a
id="FNanchor_392" href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a></p>

<p>Two hundred and twelve brave men thus emerged to life and liberty,
breaking loose from that impending fate which too soon overtook the
remainder, and preserving for future times the genuine breed and
honorable traditions of Platæa. One man alone was taken prisoner
at the brink of the outer ditch, while a few, who had enrolled
themselves originally for the enterprise, lost courage and returned
in despair even from the foot of the inner wall; telling their
comrades within that the whole band had perished. Accordingly,
at daybreak, the Platæans within sent out a herald to solicit a
truce for burial of the dead bodies, and<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_237">[p. 237]</span> it was only by the answer made to this
request, that they learned the actual truth. The description of this
memorable outbreak exhibits not less daring in the execution than
skill and foresight in the design; and is the more interesting,
inasmuch as the men who thus worked out their salvation were
precisely the bravest men, who best deserved it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Pachês and the Athenians kept Mitylênê closely blocked
up, the provisions were nearly exhausted, and the besieged were
already beginning to think of capitulation,—when their spirits
were raised by the arrival of the Lacedæmonian envoy Salæthus,
who had landed at Pyrrha on the west of Lesbos, and contrived to
steal in through a ravine which obstructed the continuity of the
blockading wall,—about February 427 <small>B.C.</small>
He encouraged the Mitylenæans to hold out, assuring them that a
Peloponnesian fleet under Alkidas was on the point of setting out
to assist them, and that Attica would be forthwith invaded by the
general Peloponnesian army. His own arrival, also, and his stay
in the town, was in itself no small encouragement: we shall see
hereafter, when we come to the siege of Syracuse by the Athenians,
how much might depend upon the presence of one single Spartan. All
thought of surrender was accordingly abandoned, and the Mitylenæans
awaited with impatience the arrival of Alkidas, who started from
Peloponnesus at the beginning of April, with forty-two triremes;
while the Lacedæmonian army at the same time invaded Attica, in
order to keep the attention of Athens fully employed. Their ravages
on this occasion were more diligent, searching, and destructive
to the country than before, and were continued the longer because
they awaited the arrival of news from Lesbos. But none reached
them, their stock of provisions was exhausted, and the army was
obliged to break up.<a id="FNanchor_393" href="#Footnote_393"
class="fnanchor">[393]</a></p>

<p>The news, when it did arrive, proved very unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>Salæthus and the Mitylenæans had held out until their provisions
were completely exhausted, but neither relief, nor tidings, reached
them from Peloponnesus. At length, even Salæthus became convinced
that no relief would come; he projected, therefore, as a last
hope, a desperate attack upon the Athenians<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_238">[p. 238]</span> and their wall of blockade. For
this purpose, he distributed full panoplies among the mass of the
people, or commons, who had hitherto been without them, having
at best nothing more than bows or javelins.<a id="FNanchor_394"
href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> But he had not
sufficiently calculated the consequences of this important step.
The Mitylenæan multitude, living under an oligarchical government,
had no interest whatever in the present contest, which had been
undertaken without any appeal to their opinion. They had no reason
for aversion to Athens, seeing that they suffered no practical
grievance from the Athenian alliance: and we shall find hereafter
that even among the subject-allies—to say nothing of a privileged
ally like Mitylênê—the bulk of the citizens were never forward,
sometimes positively reluctant, to revolt. The Mitylenæan oligarchy
had revolted, in spite of the absence of practical wrongs, because
they desired an uncontrolled town-autonomy as well as security for
its continuance: but this was a feeling to which the people were
naturally strangers, having no share in the government of their
own town, and being kept dead and passive, as it was the interest
of the oligarchy that they should be, in respect to political
sentiment. A Grecian oligarchy might obtain from its people quiet
submission under ordinary circumstances, but if ever it required
energetic effort, the genuine devotion under which alone such effort
could be given, was found wanting. Accordingly, the Mitylenæan
demos, so soon as they found themselves strengthened and ennobled
by the possession of heavy armor, refused obedience to the orders
of Salæthus for marching out and imperiling their lives in a
desperate struggle. They were under the belief—not unnatural under
the secrecy of public affairs habitually practised by an oligarchy,
but which, assuredly, the Athenian demos would have been too well
informed to entertain—that their governors were starving them, and
had concealed stores of provisions for themselves. Accordingly, the
first use which they made of their arms was, to demand that these
concealed stores should be brought out and fairly apportioned to
all, threatening, unless their demand was complied with at once,
to enter into negotiations with the Athenians, and surrender the
city.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[p. 239]</span> The ruling
Mitylenæans, unable to prevent this, but foreseeing that it would
be their irretrievable ruin, preferred the chance of negotiating
themselves for a capitulation. It was agreed with Pachês, that the
Athenian armament should enter into possession of Mitylênê; that the
fate of its people and city should be left to the Athenian assembly,
and that the Mitylenæans should send envoys to Athens to plead their
cause: until the return of these envoys, Pachês engaged that no one
should be either killed, or put in chains, or sold into slavery.
Nothing was said about Salæthus, who hid himself as well as he could
in the city. In spite of the guarantee received from Pachês, so great
was the alarm of those Mitylenæans who had chiefly instigated the
revolt, that when he actually took possession of the city, they threw
themselves as suppliants upon the altars for protection; but being
induced, by his assurances, to quit their sanctuary, were placed in
the island of Tenedos until answer should be received from Athens.<a
id="FNanchor_395" href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a></p>

<p>Having thus secured possession of Mitylênê, Pachês sent round
some triremes to the other side of the island, and easily captured
Antissa. But before he had time to reduce the two remaining towns
of Pyrrha and Eresus, he received news which forced him to turn his
attention elsewhere.</p>

<p>To the astonishment of every one, the Peloponnesian fleet of
Alkidas was seen on the coast of Ionia. It ought to have been
there much earlier, and had Alkidas been a man of energy, it
would have reached Mitylênê even before the surrender of the
city. But the Peloponnesians, when about to advance into the
Athenian waters and brave the Athenian fleet, were under the same
impressions of conscious weakness and timidity—especially since
the victories of Phormio in the preceding year—as that which beset
land-troops who marched up to attack the Lacedæmonian heavy-armed.<a
id="FNanchor_396" href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a>
Alkidas, though unobstructed by the Athenians, who were not aware
of his departure,—though pressed to hasten forward by Lesbian
and Ionian exiles on board, and aided by expert pilots from
those Samian exiles who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[p.
240]</span> had established themselves at Anæa,<a id="FNanchor_397"
href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a> on the Asiatic
continent, and acted as zealous enemies of Athens,—nevertheless,
instead of sailing straight to Lesbos, lingered first near
Peloponnesus, next at the island of Delos, making capture of private
vessels with their crews; until at length, on reaching the islands of
Ikarus and Mykonus, he heard the unwelcome tidings that the besieged
town had capitulated. Not at first crediting the report, he sailed
onward to Embaton, in the Erythræan territory on the coast of Asia
Minor, where he found the news confirmed. As only seven days had
elapsed since the capitulation had been concluded, Teutiaplus, an
Eleian captain in the fleet, strenuously urged the daring project
of sailing on forthwith, and surprising Mitylênê by night in its
existing unsettled condition: no preparation would have been made for
receiving them, and there was good chance that the Athenians might
be suddenly overpowered, the Mitylenæans again armed, and the town
recovered.</p>

<p>Such a proposition, which was indeed something more than daring,
did not suit the temper of Alkidas. Nor could he be induced by the
solicitation of the exiles to fix and fortify himself either in any
port of Ionia, or in the Æolic town of Kymê, so as to afford support
and countenance to such subjects of the Athenian empire as were
disposed to revolt; though he was confidently assured that many of
them would revolt on his proclamation, and that the satrap Pissuthnês
of Sardis would help him to defray the expense. Having been sent for
the express purpose of relieving Mitylênê, Alkidas believed himself
interdicted from any other project, and determined to return to
Peloponnesus at once, dreading nothing so much as the pursuit of
Pachês and the Athenian fleet. From Embaton, accordingly, he started
on his return, coasting southward along Asia Minor as far as Ephesus.
But the prisoners taken in his voyage were now an encumbrance to
his flight; and their number was not inconsiderable, since all the
merchant-vessels in his route had approached the fleet without
suspicion, believing it to be Athenian: a Peloponnesian fleet near
the coast of Ionia was as yet something unheard of and incredible. To
get rid of his prisoners, Alkidas stopped at Myonnêsus, near Teos,
and there put to death the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[p.
241]</span> greater number of them,—a barbarous proceeding, which
excited lively indignation among the neighboring Ionic cities to
which they belonged; insomuch that when he reached Ephesus, the
Samian exiles dwelling at Anæa, who had come forward so actively
to help him, sent him a spirited remonstrance, reminding him that
the slaughter of men neither engaged in war, nor enemies, nor even
connected with Athens, except by constraint, was disgraceful to one
who came forth as the liberator of Greece,—and that, if he persisted,
he would convert his friends into enemies, not his enemies into
friends. So keenly did Alkidas feel this animadversion, that he
at once liberated the remainder of his prisoners, several of them
Chians; and then started from Ephesus, taking his course across sea
towards Krete and Peloponnesus. After much delay off the coast of
Krete from stormy weather, which harassed and dispersed his fleet,
he at length reached in safety the harbor of Kyllênê in Elis, where
his scattered ships were ultimately reunited.<a id="FNanchor_398"
href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a></p>

<p>Thus inglorious was the voyage of the first Peloponnesian admiral
who dared to enter that <i>Mare clausum</i> which passed for a portion of
the territory of Athens.<a id="FNanchor_399" href="#Footnote_399"
class="fnanchor">[399]</a> But though he achieved little, his mere
presence excited everywhere not less dismay than astonishment: for
the Ionic towns were all unfortified, and Alkidas might take and
sack any one of them by sudden assault, even though unable to hold
it permanently. Pressing messages reached Pachês from Erythræ and
from several other places, while the Athenian triremes called Paralus
and Salaminia, the privileged vessels which usually carried public
and sacred deputations, had themselves seen the Peloponnesian fleet
anchored at Ikarus, and brought him the same intelligence. Pachês,
having his hands now free by the capture of Mitylênê, set forth
immediately in pursuit of the intruder, whom he chased as far<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[p. 242]</span> the island of Patmos.
It was there ascertained that Alkidas had finally disappeared from
the eastern waters, and the Athenian admiral, though he would have
rejoiced to meet the Peloponnesian fleet in the open sea, accounted
it fortunate that they had not taken up a position in some Asiatic
harbor,—in which case it would have been necessary for him to
undertake a troublesome and tedious blockade,<a id="FNanchor_400"
href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> besides all the
chances of revolt among the Athenian dependencies. We shall see how
much, in this respect, depended upon the personal character of the
Lacedæmonian commander, when we come hereafter to the expedition of
Brasidas.</p>

<p>On his return from Patmos to Mitylênê, Pachês was induced to
stop at Notium by the solicitations of some exiles. Notium was
the port of Kolophon, from which it was some little distance, as
Peiræus was from Athens.<a id="FNanchor_401" href="#Footnote_401"
class="fnanchor">[401]</a></p>

<p>About three years before, a violent internal dissension had taken
place in Kolophon, and one of the parties, invoking the aid of
the Persian Itamanes (seemingly one of the generals of the satrap
Pissuthnês), had placed him in possession of the town; whereupon
the opposite party, forced to retire, had established itself
separately and independently at Notium. But the Kolophonians who
remained in the town soon contrived to procure a party in Notium,
whereby they were enabled to regain possession of it, through the
aid of a body of Arcadian mercenaries in the service of Pissuthnês.
These Arcadians formed a standing garrison at Notium, in which they
occupied a separate citadel, or fortified space, while the town
became again attached as harbor to Kolophon. A considerable body of
exiles, however, expelled on that occasion, now invoked the aid of
Pachês to reinstate them, and to expel the Arcadians. On reaching
the place, the Athenian general prevailed upon Hippias, the Arcadian
captain, to come forth to a parley, under the promise that, if
nothing mutually satisfactory could be settled, he would again
replace him, “safe and sound,” in the fortification. But no sooner
had the Arcadian come forth to this parley, than Pachês, causing
him to be detained under guard, but without fetters or ill-usage,
immediately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[p. 243]</span>
attacked the fortification while the garrison were relying on the
armistice, carried it by storm, and put to death both the Arcadians
and the Persians who were found within. Having got possession of
the fortification, he next brought Hippias again into it, “safe and
sound,” according to the terms of the convention, which was thus
literally performed, and then immediately afterwards caused him to
be shot with arrows and javelins. Of this species of fraud, founded
on literal performance and real violation of an agreement, there
are various examples in Grecian history; but nowhere do we read
of a more flagitious combination of deceit and cruelty than the
behavior of Pachês at Notium. How it was noticed at Athens, we do
not know: but we may remark, not without surprise, that Thucydidês
recounts it plainly and calmly without a single word of comment.<a
id="FNanchor_402" href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a></p>

<p>Notium was separated from Kolophon, and placed in possession
of those Kolophonians who were opposed to the Persian supremacy
in the upper town. But as it had been down to this time a mere
appendage of Kolophon and not a separate town, the Athenians soon
afterwards sent œkists and performed for it the ceremonies of
colonization according to their own laws and customs, inviting from
every quarter the remaining exiles of Kolophon.<a id="FNanchor_403"
href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> Whether any new
settlers went from Athens itself, we do not know: but the step was
intended to confer a sort of Hellenic citizenship, and recognized
collective personality, on the new-born town of Notium; without
which, neither its theôry or solemn deputation would have been
admitted to offer public sacrifice, nor its private citizens to
contend for the prize, at Olympic and other great festivals.</p>

<p>Having cleared the Asiatic waters from the enemies of Athens,
Pachês returned to Lesbos, reduced the towns of Pyrrha and Eresus,
and soon found himself so completely master both of Mitylênê and
the whole island, as to be able to send home the larger part of his
force; carrying with them as prisoners those Mitylenæans who had
been deposited in Tenedos, as well as others, prominently implicated
in the late revolt, to the number altogether of rather more than a
thousand. The Lacedæmonian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[p.
244]</span> Salæthus, being recently detected in his place of
concealment, was included among the prisoners transmitted.</p>

<p>Upon the fate of these prisoners the Athenians had now to
pronounce, and they entered upon the discussion in a temper of
extreme wrath and vengeance. As to Salæthus, their resolution to
put him to death was unanimous and immediate, nor would they listen
to his promises, assuredly delusive, of terminating the blockade
of Platæa, in case his life were spared. What to do with Mitylênê
and its inhabitants was a point more doubtful, and was submitted to
formal debate in the public assembly.</p>

<p>It is in this debate that Thucydidês first takes notice of Kleon,
who is, however, mentioned by Plutarch as rising into importance some
few years earlier, during the lifetime of Periklês. Under the great
increase of trade and population in Athens and Peiræus during the
last forty years, a new class of politicians seem to have grown up,
men engaged in various descriptions of trade and manufacture, who
began to rival more or less in importance the ancient families of
Attic proprietors. This change was substantially analogous to that
which took place in the cities of mediæval Europe, when the merchants
and traders of the various guilds gradually came to compete with, and
ultimately supplanted, the patrician families in whom the supremacy
had originally resided. In Athens, persons of ancient family and
station enjoyed at this time no political privilege, and since the
reforms of Ephialtês and Periklês, the political constitution had
become thoroughly democratical. But they still continued to form the
two highest classes in the Solonian census founded on property,—the
pentakosiomedimni, and the hippeis, or knights: new men enriched
by trade doubtless got into these classes, but probably only in
minority, and imbibed the feeling of the class as they found it,
instead of bringing into it any new spirit. Now an individual
Athenian of this class, though without any legal title to preference,
yet when he stood forward as candidate for political influence,
continued to be decidedly preferred and welcomed by the social
sentiment at Athens, which preserved in its spontaneous sympathies
distinctions effaced from the political code.<a id="FNanchor_404"
href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> Besides this
place ready prepared for him in the public<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_245">[p. 245]</span> sympathy, especially advantageous at
the outset of political life,—he found himself farther borne up by
the family connections, associations, and political clubs, etc.,
which exercised very great influence both on the politics and the
judicature of Athens, and of which he became a member as a matter of
course. Such advantages were doubtless only auxiliary, carrying a man
up to a certain point of influence, but leaving him to achieve the
rest by his own personal qualities and capacity. But their effect
was nevertheless very real, and those who, without possessing them,
met and buffeted him in the public assembly, contended against great
disadvantages. A person of such low or middling station obtained no
favorable presumptions or indulgence on the part of the public to
meet him half-way,—nor had he established connections to encourage
first successes, or help him out of early scrapes. He found others
already in possession of ascendency, and well-disposed to keep down
new competitors; so that he had to win his own way unaided, from
the first step to the last, by qualities personal to himself; by
assiduity of attendance, by acquaintance with business, by powers of
striking speech, and withal by unflinching audacity, indispensable
to enable him to bear up against that opposition and enmity which
he would incur from the high-born politicians, and organized party
clubs, as soon as he appeared to be rising up into ascendency.</p>

<p>The free march of political and judicial affairs raised up several
such men, during the years beginning and immediately preceding
the Peloponnesian war. Even during the lifetime of Periklês, they
appear to have arisen in greater or less numbers: but the personal
ascendency of that great man,—who combined an aristocratical position
with a strong and genuine democratical sentiment, and an enlarged
intellect rarely found attached to either,—impressed a peculiar
character on Athenian politics. The Athenian world was divided into
his partisans and his opponents, among each of whom there were
individuals high-born and low-born,—though the aristocratical party,
properly so called, the majority of wealthy and high-born Athenians,
either opposed or disliked him. It is about two years after his
death that we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[p. 246]</span>
begin to hear of a new class of politicians: Eukratês, the
rope-seller; Kleon, the leather-seller; Lysiklês, the sheep-seller;
Hyperbolus, the lamp-maker;<a id="FNanchor_405" href="#Footnote_405"
class="fnanchor">[405]</a> the two first of whom must have been
already well-known as speakers in the ekklesia, even during the
lifetime of Periklês. Among them all, the most distinguished was
Kleon, son of Kleænetus.</p>

<p>Kleon acquired his first importance among the speakers against
Periklês, so that he would thus obtain for himself, during his
early political career, the countenance of the numerous and
aristocratical anti-Perikleans. He is described by Thucydidês in
general terms as a person of the most violent temper and character
in Athens,—as being dishonest in his calumnies, and virulent in his
invective and accusation.<a id="FNanchor_406" href="#Footnote_406"
class="fnanchor">[406]</a> Aristophanês, in his comedy of the
Knights, reproduces these features, with others new and distinct, as
well as with exaggerated details, comic, satirical, and contemptuous.
His comedy depicts Kleon in the point of view in which he would
appear to the knights of Athens,—a leather-dresser, smelling of the
tan-yard,—a low-born brawler, terrifying opponents by the violence
of his criminations, the loudness of his voice, the impudence of
his gestures,—moreover, as venal in his politics, threatening men
with accusations, and then receiving money to withdraw them; a
robber of the public treasury, persecuting merit as well as rank,
and courting the favor of the assembly by the basest and most guilty
cajolery. The general attributes set forth by Thucydidês (apart
from Aristophanês, who does not profess to write history), we may
well accept; the powerful and violent invective of Kleon, often
dishonest, together with his self-confidence and audacity in the
public assembly. Men of the middling class, like Kleon and<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[p. 247]</span> Hyperbolus, who
persevered in addressing the public assembly and trying to take a
leading part in it, against persons of greater family pretension than
themselves, were pretty sure to be men of more than usual audacity.
Had they not possessed this quality, they would never have surmounted
the opposition made to them: we may well believe that they had it
to a displeasing excess,—and even if they had not, the same measure
of self-assumption which in Alkibiadês would be tolerated from his
rank and station, would in them pass for insupportable impudence.
Unhappily, we have no specimens to enable us to appreciate the
invective of Kleon. We cannot determine whether it was more virulent
than that of Demosthenês and Æschinês, seventy years afterwards,—each
of those eminent orators imputing to the other the grossest
impudence, calumny, perjury, corruption, loud voice, and revolting
audacity of manner, in language which Kleon can hardly have surpassed
in intensity of vituperation, though he doubtless fell immeasurably
short of it in classical finish. Nor can we even tell in what degree
Kleon’s denunciations of the veteran Periklês were fiercer than those
memorable invectives against the old age of Sir Robert Walpole,
with which Lord Chatham’s political career opened. The talent for
invective possessed by Kleon, employed first against Periklês, would
be counted as great impudence by the partisans of that illustrious
statesman, as well as by impartial and judicious citizens; but among
the numerous enemies of Periklês, it would be applauded as a burst
of patriotic indignation, and would procure for the orator that
extraneous support at first which would sustain him until he acquired
his personal hold on the public assembly.<a id="FNanchor_407"
href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a></p>

<p>By what degrees or through what causes that hold was gradually
increased, we do not know; but at the time when the question of
Mitylênê came on for discussion, it had grown into a sort of
ascendency which Thucydidês describes by saying that Kleon was
“at that time by far the most persuasive speaker in the eyes of
the people.” The fact of Kleon’s great power of speech, and his
capacity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[p. 248]</span> of
handling public business in a popular manner, is better attested than
anything else respecting him, because it depends upon two witnesses
both hostile to him,—Thucydidês and Aristophanês. The assembly and
the dikastery were Kleon’s theatre and holding-ground: for the
Athenian people taken collectively in their place of meeting, and
the Athenian people taken individually, were not always the same
person and had not the same mode of judgment: Demos sitting in the
Pnyx, was a different man from Demos at home.<a id="FNanchor_408"
href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a> The lofty combination
of qualities possessed by Periklês exercised ascendency over both one
and the other; but the qualities of Kleon swayed considerably the
former without standing high in the esteem of the latter.</p>

<p>When the fate of Mitylênê and its inhabitants was submitted to the
Athenian assembly, Kleon took the lead in the discussion. There never
was a theme more perfectly suited to his violent temperament and
power of fierce invective. Taken collectively, the case of Mitylênê
presented a revolt as inexcusable and aggravated as any revolt
could be: and we have only to read the grounds of it, as set forth
by the Mitylenæan speakers themselves before the Peloponnesians at
Olympia, to be satisfied that such a proceeding, when looked at from
the Athenian point of view, would be supposed to justify, and even
to require, the very highest pitch of indignation. The Mitylenæans
admit, not only that they have no ground of complaint against Athens,
but that they have been well and honorably treated by her, with
special privilege. But they fear that she may oppress them in future:
they hate the very principle of her empire, and eagerly instigate,
as well as aid, her enemies to subdue her: they select the precise
moment in which she has been worn down by a fearful pestilence,
invasion, and cost of war. Nothing more than this would be required
to kindle the most intense wrath in the bosom of an Athenian
patriot: but there was yet another point which weighed as much as
the rest, if not more: the revolters had been the first to invite
a Peloponnesian fleet across the Ægean, and the first to proclaim,
both to Athens and her allies, the precarious tenure of her empire.<a
id="FNanchor_409" href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> The
violent Kleon would on this occasion find in<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_249">[p. 249]</span> the assembly an audience hardly less
violent than himself, and would easily be able to satisfy them that
anything like mercy to the Mitylenæans was treason to Athens. He
proposed to apply to the captive city the penalties tolerated by the
custom of war in their harshest and fullest measure: to kill the
whole Mitylenæan male population of military age, probably about six
thousand persons,—and to sell as slaves all the women and children.<a
id="FNanchor_410" href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a>
The proposition, though strongly opposed by Diodotus and others, was
sanctioned and passed by the assembly, and a trireme was forthwith
despatched to Mitylênê, enjoining Pachês to put it in execution.<a
id="FNanchor_411" href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a></p>

<p>Such a sentence was, in principle, nothing more than a very
rigorous application of the received laws of war. Not merely the
reconquered rebel, but even the prisoner of war, apart from any
special convention, was at the mercy of his conqueror, to be slain,
sold, or admitted to ransom: and we shall find the Lacedæmonians
carrying out the maxim without the smallest abatement towards the
Platæan prisoners, in the course of a very short time. And doubtless
the Athenian people, so long as they remained in assembly, under that
absorbing temporary intensification of the common and predominant
sentiment which springs from the mere fact of multitude, and so
long as they were discussing the principle of the case, What had
Mitylênê deserved? thought only of this view. Less than the most
rigorous measure of war, they would conceive, would be inadequate
to the wrong done by the Mitylenæans. But when the assembly broke
up,—when the citizen, no longer wound up by sympathizing companions
and animated speakers in the Pnyx, subsided into the comparative
quiescence of individual life,—when the talk came to be, not about
the propriety of passing such a resolution, but about the details
of executing it, a sensible change and marked repentance became
presently visible. We must also recollect, and it is a principle of
no small moment in human affairs, especially among a democratical
people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[p. 250]</span> like
the Athenians, who stand charged with so many resolutions passed
and afterwards unexecuted, that the sentiment of wrath against the
Mitylenæans had been really in part discharged by the mere <i>passing</i>
of the sentence, quite apart from its execution; just as a furious
man relieves himself from overboiling anger by imprecations against
others which he would himself shrink from afterwards realizing. The
Athenians, on the whole the most humane people in Greece,—though
humanity, according to our ideas, cannot be predicated of any
Greeks,—became sensible that they had sanctioned a cruel and
frightful decree, and the captain and seamen,<a id="FNanchor_412"
href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a> to whom it was given
to carry, set forth on their voyage with mournful repugnance. The
Mitylenæan envoys present in Athens, who had probably been allowed
to speak in the assembly and plead their own cause, together with
those Athenians who had been proxeni and friends of Mitylênê, and
the minority generally of the previous assembly, soon discerned, and
did their best to foster, this repentance; which became, during the
course of the same evening, so powerful as well as so wide-spread,
that the stratêgi acceded to the prayer of the envoys, and convoked
a fresh assembly for the morrow to reconsider the proceeding. By so
doing, they committed an illegality, and exposed themselves to the
chance of impeachment: but the change of feeling among the people was
so manifest as to overbear any such scruples.<a id="FNanchor_413"
href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a></p>

<p>Though Thucydidês had given us only a short summary, without
any speeches, of what passed in the first assembly,—yet as to the
second assembly, he gives us at length the speeches both of Kleon
and Diodotus, the two principal orators of the first also. We may
be sure that this second assembly was in all points one of the most
interesting and anxious of the whole war;<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_251">[p. 251]</span> and though we cannot certainly
determine what were the circumstances which determined Thucydidês
in his selection of speeches, yet this cause, as well as the signal
defeat of Kleon, whom he disliked, may probably be presumed to
have influenced him here. That orator came forward to defend his
proposition passed on the preceding day, and denounced in terms of
indignation the unwise tenderness and scruples of the people, who
could not bear to treat their subject-allies, according to the plain
reality, as men held only by naked fear. He dwelt upon the mischief
and folly of reversing on one day what had been decided on the day
preceding,—upon the guilty ambition of orators, who sacrificed the
most valuable interests of the commonwealth either to pecuniary
gains, or to the personal credit of speaking with effect, triumphing
over rivals, and setting up their own fancies in place of fact and
reality. He deprecated the mistaken encouragement given to such
delusions by a public “wise beyond what was written,” who came to the
assembly, not to apply their good sense in judging of public matters,
but merely for the delight of hearing speeches.<a id="FNanchor_414"
href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> He restated the
heinous and unprovoked wrong committed by the Mitylenæans,—and the
grounds for inflicting upon them that maximum of punishment which
“justice” enjoined. He called for “justice” against them; nothing
less, but nothing more: warning the assembly that the imperial
necessities of Athens essentially required the constant maintenance
of a sentiment of fear in the minds of unwilling subjects, and that
they must prepare to see their empire pass away if they suffered
themselves to be guided either by compassion for those who, if
victors, would have no compassion on them,<a id="FNanchor_415"
href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a>—or by unseasonable
moderation towards those who would neither feel nor requite<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[p. 252]</span> it,—or by the mere
impression of seductive discourses. Justice against the Mitylenæans,
not less than the strong political interests of Athens, required
the infliction of the sentence decreed on the day preceding.<a
id="FNanchor_416" href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a></p>

<p>The harangue of Kleon is in many respects remarkable. If we are
surprised to find a man, whose whole importance resided in his
tongue, denouncing so severely the license and the undue influence of
speech in the public assembly, we must recollect that Kleon had the
advantage of addressing himself to the intense prevalent sentiment of
the moment,—that he could, therefore, pass off the dictates of this
sentiment as plain, downright, honest sense and patriotism; while the
opponents, speaking against the reigning sentiment, and therefore
driven to collateral argument, circumlocution, and more or less of
manœuvre, might be represented as mere clever sophists, showing
their talents in making the worse appear the better reason,—if not
actually bribed, at least unprincipled, and without any sincere moral
conviction. As this is a mode of dealing with questions both of
public concern and of private morality, not less common at present
than it was in the time of the Peloponnesian war,—to seize upon some
strong and tolerably wide-spread sentiment among the public, to treat
the dictates of that sentiment as plain common sense and obvious
right, and then to shut out all rational estimate of coming good
and evil as if it were unholy or immoral, or at best mere uncandid
subtlety,—we may well notice a case in which Kleon employs it to
support a proposition now justly regarded as barbarous.</p>

<p>Applying our modern views to this proposition, indeed, the
prevalent sentiment would not only not be in favor of Kleon, but
would be irresistibly in favor of his opponents. To put to death
in cold blood some six thousand persons, would so revolt modern
feelings, as to overbalance all considerations of past misconduct in
the persons to be condemned. Nevertheless, the speech of Diodotus,
who followed and opposed Kleon, not only contains no appeal to
any such merciful predispositions, but even positively<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[p. 253]</span> disclaims appealing
to them: the orator deprecates, not less than Kleon, the influence
of compassionate sentiment, or of a spirit of mere compromise
and moderation.<a id="FNanchor_417" href="#Footnote_417"
class="fnanchor">[417]</a> He farther discards considerations of
justice or the analogies of criminal judicature,<a id="FNanchor_418"
href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a>—and rests his
opposition altogether upon reasons of public prudence, bearing upon
the future welfare and security of Athens.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[p. 254]</span></p>

<p>He begins by vindicating<a id="FNanchor_419" href="#Footnote_419"
class="fnanchor">[419]</a> the necessity of reconsidering the
resolution just passed, and insists on the mischief of deciding
so important a question in haste or under strong passion; he
enters a protest against the unwarrantable insinuations of
corruption or self-conceit by which Kleon had sought to silence or
discredit his opponents;<a id="FNanchor_420" href="#Footnote_420"
class="fnanchor">[420]</a> and then, taking up the question on the
ground of public wisdom and prudence, he proceeds to show that
the rigorous sentence decreed on the preceding day was not to be
defended. That sentence would not prevent any other among the
subject-allies from revolting, if they saw, or fancied that they
saw, a fair chance of success: but it might perhaps drive them,<a
id="FNanchor_421" href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a>
if once embarked in revolt, to persist even to desperation, and
bury themselves under the ruins of their city. While every means
ought to be employed to prevent them from revolting, by precautions
beforehand, it was a mistaken reckoning to try to deter them by
enormity of punishment, inflicted afterwards upon such as were
reconquered. In developing this argument, the speaker gives some
remarkable views on the theory of punishment generally, and on the
small addition obtained in the way of preventive effect even by the
greatest aggravation of the suffering inflicted upon the condemned
criminal,—views which might have passed as rare and profound even
down to the last century.<a id="FNanchor_422" href="#Footnote_422"
class="fnanchor">[422]</a> And he farther supports his argument
by emphatically setting forth the impolicy of confounding the
Mitylenæan Demos in the same punishment with their oligarchy: the
revolt had been the act exclusively of the latter, and the former had
not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[p. 255]</span> only taken
no part in it, but, as soon as they obtained possession of arms, had
surrendered the city spontaneously. In all the allied cities, it was
the commons who were well-affected to Athens, and upon whom her hold
chiefly depended against the doubtful fidelity of the oligarchies:<a
id="FNanchor_423" href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a>
but this feeling could not possibly continue, if it were now seen
that all the Mitylenæans indiscriminately were confounded in one
common destruction. Diodotus concludes by recommending that those
Mitylenæans whom Pachês had sent to Athens as chiefs of the revolt,
should be put upon their trial separately; but that the remaining
population should be spared.<a id="FNanchor_424" href="#Footnote_424"
class="fnanchor">[424]</a></p>

<p>This speech is that of a man who feels that he has the reigning
and avowed sentiment of the audience against him, and that he must
therefore win his way by appeals to their reason. The same appeals,
however, might have been made, and perhaps had been made, during the
preceding discussion, without success; but Diodotus knew that the
reigning sentiment, though still ostensibly predominant, had been
silently undermined during the last few hours, and that the reaction
towards pity and moderation, which had been growing up under it,
would work in favor of his arguments, though he might disclaim all
intention of invoking its aid. After several other discourses, both
for and against,—the assembly came to a vote, and the proposition
of Diodotus was adopted; but adopted by so small a majority,
that the decision seemed at first doubtful.<a id="FNanchor_425"
href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a></p>

<p>But the trireme carrying the first vote had started the day
before, and was already twenty-four hours on its way to Mitylênê. A
second trireme was immediately put to sea, bearing the new decree;
yet nothing short of superhuman exertions could enable it to reach
the condemned city before the terrific sentence now on its way might
be actually in course of execution. The Mitylenæan envoys stored
the vessel well with provisions, promising<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_256">[p. 256]</span> large rewards to the crew if they
arrived in time; and an intensity of effort was manifested, without
parallel in the history of Athenian seamanship,—the oar being
never once relaxed between Athens and Mitylênê, and the rowers
merely taking turns for short intervals of rest, with refreshment
of barley-meal steeped with wine and oil swallowed on their seats.
Luckily, there was no unfavorable wind to retard them: but the object
would have been defeated, if it had not happened that the crew of
the first trireme were as slow and averse in the transmission of
their rigorous mandate, as those of the second were eager for the
delivery of the reprieve in time. And, after all, it came no more
than just in time; the first trireme had arrived, the order for
execution was actually in the hands of Pachês, and his measures were
already preparing. So near was the Mitylenæan population to this
wholesale destruction:<a id="FNanchor_426" href="#Footnote_426"
class="fnanchor">[426]</a> so near was Athens to the actual
perpetration of an enormity which would have raised against her
throughout Greece a sentiment of exasperation more deadly than that
which she afterwards incurred even from the proceedings at Melos,
Skiônê, and elsewhere. Had the execution been realized, the person
who would have suffered most by it, and most deservedly, would
have been the proposer, Kleon. For if the reaction in Athenian
sentiment was so immediate and sensible after the mere passing of
the sentence, far more violent would it have been when they learned
that the deed had been irrevocably done, and when all its painful
details were presented to their imaginations: and Kleon would have
been held responsible as the author of that which had so disgraced
them in their own eyes. As the case turned out, he was fortunate
enough to escape this danger; and his proposition, to put to death
those Mitylenæans whom Pachês had sent home as the active revolting
party, was afterwards adopted and executed. It doubtless appeared so
moderate after the previous decree passed but rescinded, as to be
adopted with little resistance, and to provoke no after-repentance:
yet the men so slain were rather more than one thousand in number.<a
id="FNanchor_427" href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a></p>

<p>Besides this sentence of execution, the Athenians razed the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[p. 257]</span> fortifications of
Mitylênê, and took possession of all her ships of war. In lieu of
tribute, they farther established a new permanent distribution of
the land of the island; all except Methymna, which had remained
faithful to them. They distributed it into three thousand lots, of
which three hundred were reserved for consecration to the gods,
and the remainder assigned to Athenian kleruchs, or proprietary
settlers, chosen by lot among the citizens; the Lesbian proprietors
still remaining on the land as cultivating tenants, and paying to
the Athenian kleruch an annual rent of two minæ, near four pounds
sterling, for each lot. We should have been glad to learn more
about this new land-settlement than the few words of the historian
suffice to explain. It would seem that two thousand seven hundred
Athenian citizens, with their families must have gone to reside,
for the time at least, in Lesbos, as kleruchs; that is, without
abnegating their rights as Athenian citizens, and without being
exonerated either from Athenian taxation, or from personal military
service. But it seems certain that these men did not continue long
to reside in Lesbos: and we may even suspect that the kleruchic
allotment of the island must have been subsequently abrogated. There
was a strip on the opposite mainland of Asia, which had hitherto
belonged to Mitylênê; this was now separated from that town, and
henceforward enrolled among the tributary subjects of Athens.<a
id="FNanchor_428" href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[p. 258]</span></p> <p>To
the misfortunes of Mitylênê belongs, as a suitable appendix, the
fate of Pachês, the Athenian commander, whose perfidy at Notium
has been recently recounted. It appears, that having contracted
a passion for two beautiful free women at Mitylênê, Hellânis and
Lamaxis, he slew their husbands, and got possession of them by
force. Possibly, they may have had private friends at Athens, which
must of course have been the case with many<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_259">[p. 259]</span> Mitylenæan families: at all events they
repaired thither, bent on obtaining redress for this outrage, and
brought their complaint against Pachês before the Athenian dikastery,
in that trial of accountability to which every officer was liable
at the close of his command. So profound was the sentiment which
their case excited, in this open and numerous assembly of Athenian
citizens, that the guilty commander, not waiting for sentence,
slew himself with his sword in open court.<a id="FNanchor_429"
href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a></p> <p><span
class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[p. 260]</span></p> <p>The surrender
of Platæa to the Lacedæmonians took place not long after that of
Mitylênê to the Athenians,—somewhat later in the same summer. Though
the escape of one-half of the garrison had made the provisions last
longer for the rest, still they had now come to be exhausted, and
the remaining defenders were enfeebled and on the point of perishing
by starvation. The Lacedæmonian commander of the blockading force,
knowing their defenceless condition, could easily have taken the
town by storm, had he not been forbidden by express orders from
Sparta. For the Spartan government, calculating that peace might one
day be concluded with Athens on terms of mutual cession of places
acquired by war, wished to acquire Platæa, not by force but by
capitulation and voluntary surrender, which would serve as an excuse
for not giving it up: though such a distinction, between capture
by force and by capitulation, not admissible in modern diplomacy,
was afterwards found to tell against the Lacedæmonians quite as
much as in their favor.<a id="FNanchor_430" href="#Footnote_430"
class="fnanchor">[430]</a> Acting upon these orders, the Lacedæmonian
commander sent in a herald, summoning the Platæans to surrender
voluntarily, and submit themselves to the Lacedæmonians as
judges,—with a stipulation “that the wrong-doers<a id="FNanchor_431"
href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a> should be punished,
but that none should be punished unjustly.” To the besieged, in
their state of hopeless starvation, all terms were nearly alike, and
they accordingly surrendered the city. After a few days’ interval,
during which they received nourishment from the blockading army, five
persons arrived from Sparta to sit in judgment upon their fate,—one,
Aristomenidas, a Herakleid of the regal family.<a id="FNanchor_432"
href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a></p>

<p>The five Spartans having taken their seat as judges, doubtless
in full presence of the blockading army, and especially with the
Thebans, the great enemies of Platæa, by their side,—the prisoners
taken, two hundred Platæans and twenty-five Athenians, were
brought up for trial, or sentence. No accusation was pre<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[p. 261]</span>ferred against them
by any one: but the simple question was put to them by the judges:
“Have you, during the present war, rendered any service to the
Lacedæmonians or to their allies?” The Platæans were confounded at a
question alike unexpected and preposterous: it admitted but of one
answer,—but before returning any categorical answer at all, they
entreated permission to plead their cause at length. In spite of the
opposition of the Thebans,<a id="FNanchor_433" href="#Footnote_433"
class="fnanchor">[433]</a> their request was granted: and Astymachus
and Lakon, the latter proxenus of Sparta at Platæa, were appointed to
speak on behalf of the body. Possibly, both these delegates may have
spoken: if so, Thucydidês has blended the two speeches into one.</p>

<p>A more desperate position cannot be imagined, for the
interrogatory was expressly so framed as to exclude allusion to
any facts preceding the Peloponnesian war,—but the speakers,
though fully conscious how slight was their chance of success,
disregarded the limits of the question itself, and while upholding
with unshaken courage the dignity of their little city, neglected
no topic which could touch the sympathies of their judges. After
remonstrating against the mere mockery of trial and judgment to which
they were submitted, they appealed to the Hellenic sympathies, and
lofty reputation for commanding virtue, of the Lacedæmonians,—they
adverted to the first alliance of Platæa with Athens, concluded at
the recommendation of the Lacedæmonians themselves, who had then
declined, though formally solicited, to undertake the protection
of the town against Theban oppression. They next turned to the
Persian war, wherein Platæan patriotism towards Greece was
not less conspicuous than Theban treason,<a id="FNanchor_434"
href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a>—to the victory
gained over the Persians on their soil, whereby it had become
hallowed under the promises of Pausanias, and by solemn appeals
to the local gods. From the Persian war, they passed on to the
flagitious attack made by the Thebans on Platæa, in the midst of
the truce,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[p. 262]</span>—nor
did they omit to remind the judges of an obligation personal to
Sparta,—the aid which they had rendered, along with the Athenians,
to Sparta, when pressed by the revolt of the Helots at Ithôme. This
speech is as touching as any which we find in Thucydidês, and the
skill of it consists in the frequency with which the hearers are
brought back, time after time, and by well-managed transitions,
to these same topics.<a id="FNanchor_435" href="#Footnote_435"
class="fnanchor">[435]</a> And such was the impression which it
seemed to make on the five Lacedæmonian judges, that the Thebans near
at hand found themselves under the necessity of making a reply to
it: although we see plainly that the whole scheme of proceeding—the
formal and insulting question, as well as the sentence destined to
follow upon answer given—had been settled beforehand between them and
the Lacedæmonians.</p>

<p>The Theban speakers contended that the Platæans had deserved,
and brought upon themselves by their own fault, the enmity of
Thebes,—that they had stood forward earnestly against the Persians,
only because Athens had done so too, and that all the merit, whatever
it might be, which they had thereby acquired, was counterbalanced
and cancelled by their having allied themselves with Athens
afterwards for the oppression and enslavement of the Æginetans, and
of other Greeks equally conspicuous for zeal against Xerxes, and
equally entitled to protection under the promises of Pausanias. The
Thebans went on to vindicate their nocturnal surprise of Platæa,
by maintaining that they had been invited by the most respectable
citizens of the town,<a id="FNanchor_436" href="#Footnote_436"
class="fnanchor">[436]</a> who were anxious only to bring back
Platæa from its alliance with a stranger to its natural Bœotian
home,—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[p. 263]</span> that
they had abstained from anything like injurious treatment of the
inhabitants, until constrained to use force in their own defence.
They then reproached the Platæans, in their turn, with that breach
of faith whereby ultimately the Theban prisoners in the town had
been put to death. And while they excused their alliance with
Xerxes, at the time of the Persian invasion, by affirming that
Thebes was then under a dishonest party-oligarchy, who took this
side for their own factious purposes, and carried the people with
them by force,—they at the same time charged the Platæans with
permanent treason against the Bœotian customs and brotherhood.<a
id="FNanchor_437" href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a>
All this was farther enforced by setting forth the claims of Thebes
to the gratitude of Lacedæmon, both for having brought Bœotia into
the Lacedæmonian alliance, at the time of the battle of Korôneia,
and for having furnished so large a portion of the common force in
the war then going on.<a id="FNanchor_438" href="#Footnote_438"
class="fnanchor">[438]</a></p>

<p>The discourse of the Thebans, inspired by bitter, and as yet
unsatisfied hatred against Platæa, proved effectual: or rather
it was superfluous,—the minds of the Lacedæmonians having before
been made up. After the proposition twice made by Archidamus to
the Platæans, inviting them to remain neutral, and even offering
to guarantee their neutrality,—after the solemn apologetic protest
tendered by him upon their refusal, to the gods, before he began the
siege,—the Lacedæmonians conceived themselves exonerated from all
obligation to respect the sanctity of the place;<a id="FNanchor_439"
href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a> looking upon the
inhabitants as having voluntarily renounced their inviolability and
sealed their own ruin. Hence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[p.
264]</span> the importance attached to that protest, and the
emphatic detail with which it is set forth in Thucydidês. The
five judges, as their only reply to the two harangues, again
called the Platæans before them, and repeated to every one of
them individually, the same question which had before been put:
each one of them, as he successively replied in the negative,<a
id="FNanchor_440" href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a>
was taken away and killed, together with the twenty-five Athenian
prisoners. The women captured were sold as slaves: and the town and
territory of Platæa were handed over to the Thebans, who at first
established in them a few oligarchical Platæan exiles, together with
some Megarian exiles,—but after a few months recalled this step,
and blotted out Platæa,<a id="FNanchor_441" href="#Footnote_441"
class="fnanchor">[441]</a> as a separate town and territory,
from the muster-roll of Hellas. They pulled down all the private
buildings and employed the materials to build a vast barrack all
round the Heræum, or temple of Hêrê, two hundred feet in every
direction, with apartments of two stories above and below; partly as
accommodation for visitors to the temple, partly as an abode for the
tenant-farmers or graziers who were to occupy the land. A new temple
of one hundred feet in length, was also built in honor of Hêrê, and
ornamented with couches, prepared from the brass and iron furniture
found in the private houses of the Platæans.<a id="FNanchor_442"
href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a> The Platæan territory
was let out for ten years, as public property belonging to Thebes,
and was hired by private Theban cultivators.</p>

<p>Such was the melancholy fate of Platæa, after sustaining a
blockade of about two years.<a id="FNanchor_443" href="#Footnote_443"
class="fnanchor">[443]</a> Its identity and local traditions<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[p. 265]</span> seemed thus
extinguished, and the sacrifices, in honor of the deceased victors
who had fought under Pausanias, suspended,—which the Platæan speakers
had urged upon the Lacedæmonians as an impiety not to be tolerated,<a
id="FNanchor_444" href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a>
and which perhaps the latter would hardly have consented to
under any other circumstances except from an anxious desire of
conciliating the Thebans in their prominent antipathy. It is in
this way that Thucydidês explains the conduct of Sparta, which he
pronounces to have been rigorous in the extreme.<a id="FNanchor_445"
href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> And in truth it
was more rigorous, considering only the principle of the case, and
apart from the number of victims, than even the first unexecuted
sentence of Athens against the Mitylenæans: for neither Sparta,
nor even Thebes, had any fair pretence for considering Platæa as a
revolted town, whereas Mitylênê was a city which had revolted under
circumstances peculiarly offensive to Athens. Moreover, Sparta
promised trial and justice to the Platæans on their surrender: Pachês
promised nothing to the Mitylenæans, except that their fate should
be reserved for the decision of the Athenian people. This little
city—interesting from its Hellenic patriotism, its grateful and
tenacious attachments, and its unmerited suffering—now existed only
in the persons of its citizens harbored at Athens: we shall find it
hereafter restored, destroyed again, and finally again restored:
so checkered was the fate of a little Grecian state swept away by
the contending politics of the greater neighbors. The slaughter
of the twenty-five Athe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[p.
266]</span>nian prisoners, like that of Salæthus by the Athenians,
was not beyond the rigor admitted and tolerated, though not always
practised, on both sides, towards prisoners of war.</p>

<p>We have now gone through the circumstances, painfully illustrating
the manners of the age, which followed on the surrender of Mitylênê
and Platæa. We next pass to the west of Greece,—the island of
Korkyra,—where we shall find scenes not less bloody, and even more
revolting.</p>

<p>It has been already mentioned,<a id="FNanchor_446"
href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a> that in the naval
combats between the Corinthians and Korkyræans during the year
before the Peloponnesian war, the former had captured two hundred
and fifty Korkyræan prisoners, men of the first rank and consequence
in the island. Instead of following the impulse of blind hatred in
slaughtering their prisoners, the Corinthians displayed, if not
greater humanity, at least a more long-sighted calculation: they had
treated the prisoners well, and made every effort to gain them over,
with a view of employing them on the first opportunity to effect a
revolution in the island,—to bring it into alliance with Corinth,<a
id="FNanchor_447" href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a>
and disconnect it from Athens. Such an opportunity appears first to
have occurred during the winter or spring of the present year, while
both Mitylênê and Platæa were under blockade; probably about the
time when Alkidas departed for Ionia, and when it was hoped that not
only Mitylênê would be relieved, but the neighboring dependencies
of Athens excited to revolt, and her whole attention thus occupied
in that quarter. Accordingly, the Korkyræan prisoners were then
sent home from Corinth, nominally under a heavy ransom of eight
hundred talents, for which those Korkyræan citizens who acted as
proxeni to Corinth made themselves responsible:<a id="FNanchor_448"
href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a> the proxeni, lending
themselves thus to the deception, were doubtless participant in the
entire design.</p>

<p>But it was soon seen in what form the ransom was really to
be paid. The new-comers, probably at first heartily welcomed,
after so long a detention, employed all their influence, combined
with the most active personal canvass, to bring about a complete
rupture of all alliance with Athens. Intimation being sent to<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[p. 267]</span> Athens of what was
going on, an Athenian trireme arrived with envoys to try and defeat
these manœuvres; while a Corinthian trireme also brought envoys from
Corinth to aid the views of the opposite party. The mere presence
of Corinthian envoys indicated a change in the political feeling of
the island: but still more conspicuous did this change become, when
a formal public assembly, after hearing both envoys, decided,—that
Korkyra would maintain her alliance with Athens according to the
limited terms of simple mutual defence originally stipulated;<a
id="FNanchor_449" href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a>
but would at the same time be in relations of friendship with the
Peloponnesians, as she had been before the Epidamnian quarrel. But
the alliance between Athens and Korkyra had since become practically
more intimate, and the Korkyræan fleet had aided the Athenians in the
invasion of Peloponnesus:<a id="FNanchor_450" href="#Footnote_450"
class="fnanchor">[450]</a> accordingly, the resolution, now adopted,
abandoned the present to go back to the past,—and to a past which
could not be restored.</p>

<p>Looking to the war then raging between Athens and the
Peloponnesians, such a declaration was self-contradictory: nor,
indeed, did the oligarchical party intend it as anything else than
a step to a more complete revolution, both foreign and domestic.
They followed it up by a political prosecution against Peithias,
the citizen of greatest personal influence among the people, who
acted by his own choice as proxenus to the Athenians. They accused
him of practising to bring Korkyra into slavery to Athens. What
were the judicial institutions of the island, under which he was
tried, we do not know: but he was acquitted of the charge; and he
then revenged himself by accusing in his turn five of the richest
among his oligarchical prosecutors, of the crime of sacrilege,—as
having violated the sanctity of the sacred grove of Zeus and
Alkinous, by causing stakes, for their vine-props, to be cut in it.<a
id="FNanchor_451" href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a>
This was an act distinctly forbidden by law, under<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[p. 268]</span> penalty of a stater
or four drachms for every stake so cut: but it is no uncommon
phenomenon, even in societies politically better organized than
Korkyra, to find laws existing and unrepealed, yet habitually
violated, sometimes even by every one, but still oftener by men of
wealth and power, whom most people would be afraid to prosecute:
moreover, in this case, no individual was injured by the act, and
any one who came forward to prosecute would incur the odium of an
informer,—which probably Peithias might not have chosen to brave
under ordinary circumstances, though he thought himself justified in
adopting this mode of retaliation against those who had prosecuted
him. The language of Thucydidês implies that the fact was not denied:
nor is there any difficulty in conceiving that these rich men may
have habitually resorted to the sacred property for vine-stakes. On
being found guilty and condemned, they cast themselves as suppliants
at the temples, and entreated the indulgence of being allowed to pay
the fine by instalments: but Peithias, then a member of the (annual)
senate, to whom the petition was referred, opposed it, and caused
its rejection, leaving the law to take its course. It was moreover
understood, that he was about to avail himself of his character of
senator,—and of his increased favor, probably arising from the recent
judicial acquittal,—to propose in the public assembly a reversal of
the resolution recently passed, and a new resolution to recognize
only the same friends and the same enemies as Athens.</p>

<p>Pressed by the ruinous fine upon the five persons condemned,
as well as by the fear that Peithias might carry his point and
thus completely defeat their project of Corinthian alliance, the
oligarchical party resolved to carry their point by violence and
murder. They collected a party armed with daggers, burst sud<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[p. 269]</span>denly into the
senate-house during full sitting, and there slew Peithias with
sixty other persons, partly senators, partly private individuals:
some others of his friends escaped the same fate by getting
aboard the Attic trireme which had brought the envoys, and which
was still in the harbor, but now departed forthwith to Athens.
These assassins, under the fresh terror arising from their recent
act, convoked an assembly, affirmed that what they had done was
unavoidable to guard Korkyra against being made the slave of
Athens, and proposed a resolution of full neutrality, both towards
Athens and towards the Peloponnesians,—to receive no visit from
either of the belligerents, except of a pacific character, and with
one single ship at a time. And this resolution the assembly was
constrained to pass,—it probably was not very numerous, and the
oligarchical partisans were at hand in arms.<a id="FNanchor_452"
href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a> At the same time
they sent envoys to Athens, to communicate the recent events with
such coloring as suited their views, and to dissuade the fugitive
partisans of Peithias from provoking any armed Athenian intervention,
such as might occasion a counter-revolution in the island.<a
id="FNanchor_453" href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a>
With some of the fugitives, representations of this sort, or perhaps
the fear of compromising their own families, left behind, prevailed:
but most of them, and the Athenians along with them, appreciated
better both what had been done, and what was likely to follow. The
oligarchical envoys, together with such of the fugitives as had
been induced to adopt their views, were seized by the Athenians as
conspirators, and placed in detention at Ægina; while a fleet of
sixty Athenian triremes, under Eurymedon, was immediately fitted
out to sail for Korkyra,—for which there was the greater necessity,
as the Lacedæmonian fleet, under Alkidas, lately mustered at
Kyllênê after its return from Ionia, was understood to be on the
point of sailing thither.<a id="FNanchor_454" href="#Footnote_454"
class="fnanchor">[454]</a></p>

<p>But the oligarchical leaders at Korkyra knew better than to rely
on the chances of this mission to Athens, and proceeded in<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[p. 270]</span> the execution of
their conspiracy with that rapidity which was best calculated to
insure its success. On the arrival of a Corinthian trireme, which
brought ambassadors from Sparta, and probably also brought news that
the fleet of Alkidas would shortly appear,—they organized their
force, and attacked the people and the democratical authorities.
The Korkyræan Demos were at first vanquished and dispersed; but
during the night they collected together and fortified themselves
in the upper parts of the town near the acropolis, and from thence
down to the Hyllaic harbor, one of the two harbors which the town
possessed; while the other harbor and the chief arsenal, facing the
mainland of Epirus, was held by the oligarchical party, together
with the market-place near to it, in and around which the wealthier
Korkyræans chiefly resided. In this divided state the town remained
throughout the ensuing day, during which the Demos sent emissaries
round the territory soliciting aid from the working slaves, and
promising to them emancipation as a reward; while the oligarchy
also hired and procured eight hundred Epirotic mercenaries from
the mainland. Reinforced by the slaves, who flocked in at the
call received, the Demos renewed the struggle on the morrow, more
furiously than before. Both in position and numbers they had the
advantage over the oligarchy, and the intense resolution with which
they fought communicated itself even to the women, who, braving
danger and tumult, took active part in the combat, especially by
flinging tiles from the housetops. Towards the afternoon, the people
became decidedly victorious, and were even on the point of carrying
by assault the lower town, together with the neighboring arsenal,
both held by the oligarchy,—nor had the latter any other chance
of safety except the desperate resource of setting fire to that
part of the town, with the market-place, houses, and buildings all
around it, their own among the rest. This proceeding drove back the
assailants, but destroyed much property belonging to merchants in
the warehouses, together with a large part of the town: indeed, had
the wind been favorable the entire town would have been consumed.
The people being thus victorious, the Corinthian trireme, together
with most of the Epirotic mercenaries, thought it safer to leave the
island; while the victors were still farther strengthened on the
ensuing morning by the arrival of the Athenian<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_271">[p. 271]</span> admiral Nikostratus, with twelve
triremes from Naupaktus,<a id="FNanchor_455" href="#Footnote_455"
class="fnanchor">[455]</a> and five hundred Messenian hoplites.</p>

<p>Nikostratus did his best to allay the furious excitement
prevailing, and to persuade the people to use their victory with
moderation. Under his auspices, a convention of amnesty and peace was
concluded between the contending parties, save only ten proclaimed
individuals of the most violent oligarchs, who were to be tried
as ringleaders: these men of course soon disappeared, so that
there would have been no trial at all, which seems to have been
what Nikostratus desired. At the same time an alliance offensive
and defensive was established between Korkyra and Athens, and the
Athenian admiral was then on the point of departing, when the
Korkyræan leaders entreated him to leave with them, for greater
safety, five ships out of his little fleet of twelve,—offering
him five of their own triremes instead. Notwithstanding the peril
of this proposition to himself, Nikostratus acceded to it, and
the Korkyræans, preparing the five ships to be sent along with
him, began to enroll among the crews the names of their principal
enemies. To the latter this presented the appearance of sending
them to Athens, which they accounted a sentence of death. Under
this impression they took refuge as suppliants in the temple of
the Dioskuri, where Nikostratus went to visit them and tried to
reassure them by the promise that nothing was intended against
their personal safety. But he found it impossible to satisfy them,
and as they persisted in refusing to serve, the Korkyræan Demos
began to suspect treachery. They took arms again, searched the
houses of the recusants for arms, and were bent on putting some
of them to death, if Nikostratus had not taken them under his
protection. The principal men of the defeated party, to the number
of about four hundred, now took sanctuary in the temple and sacred
ground of Hêrê; and the leaders of the people, afraid that in this
inviolable position they might still cause further insurrection
in the city, opened a negotiation and prevailed upon them to be
ferried across to the little island immediately opposite to the
Heræum; where they were kept under watch, with provisions regularly
transmitted across to them, for four days.<a id="FNanchor_456"
href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a></p> <p><span
class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[p. 272]</span></p> <p>At the end
of these four days, while the uneasiness of the popular leaders
still continued, and Nikostratus still adjourned his departure,
a new phase opened in this melancholy drama. The Peloponnesian
fleet under Alkidas arrived at the road of Sybota on the opposite
mainland,—fifty-three triremes in number, for the forty triremes
brought back from Ionia had been reinforced by thirteen more from
Leukas and Ambrakia, and the Lacedæmonians had sent down Brasidas
as advising companion,—himself worth more than the new thirteen
triremes, if he had been sent to supersede Alkidas, instead of
bringing nothing but authority to advise.<a id="FNanchor_457"
href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a> Despising the small
squadron of Nikostratus, then at Naupaktus, they were only anxious to
deal with Korkyra before reinforcements should arrive from Athens:
but the repairs necessary for the ships of Alkidas, after their
disastrous voyage home, occasioned an unfortunate delay. When the
Peloponnesian fleet was seen approaching from Sybota at break of
day, the confusion in Korkyra was unspeakable: the Demos and the
newly-emancipated slaves were agitated alike by the late terrible
combat and by fear of the invaders,—the oligarchical party, though
defeated, was still present and forming a considerable minority, and
the town was half burnt. Amidst such elements of trouble, there was
little authority to command, and still less confidence or willingness
to obey. Plenty of triremes were indeed at hand, and orders were
given to man sixty of them forthwith,—while Nikostratus, the only man
who preserved the cool courage necessary for effective resistance,
entreated the Korkyræan leaders to proceed with regularity, and to
wait till all were manned, so as to sail forth from the harbor in
a body. He offered himself with his twelve Athenian triremes to go
forth first alone, and occupy the Peloponnesian fleet, until the
Korkyræan sixty triremes could all come out in full array to support
him. He accordingly went forth with his squadron; but the Korkyræans,
instead of following his advice, sent their ships out one by one and
without any selection of crews. Two of them deserted forthwith to the
enemy, while others presented the spectacle of crews fighting among
themselves; even those which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[p.
273]</span> actually joined battle came up by single ships, without
the least order or concert.</p>

<p>The Peloponnesians, soon seeing that they had little to fear from
such enemies, thought it sufficient to set twenty of their ships
against the Korkyræans, while with the remaining thirty-three they
moved forward to contend with the twelve Athenians. Nikostratus,
having plenty of sea-room, was not afraid of this numerical
superiority,—the more so, as two of his twelve triremes were the
picked vessels of the Athenian navy,—the Salaminia and the Paralus.<a
id="FNanchor_458" href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a>
He took care to avoid entangling himself with the centre of the
enemy, and to keep rowing about their flanks; and as he presently
contrived to disable one of their ships, by a fortunate blow with
the beak of one of his vessels, the Peloponnesians, instead of
attacking him with their superior numbers, formed themselves into
a circle and stood on the defensive, as they had done in the first
combat with Phormio in the middle of the strait at Rhium. Nikostratus
(like Phormio) rowed round this circle, trying to cause confusion by
feigned approach, and waiting to see some of the ships lose their
places or run foul of each other, so as to afford him an opening
for attack. And he might perhaps have succeeded, if the remaining
twenty Peloponnesian ships, seeing the proceeding, and recollecting
with dismay the success of a similar manœuvre in the former battle,
had not quitted the Korkyræan ships, whose disorderly condition they
despised, and hastened to join their comrades. The whole fleet of
fifty-three triremes now again took the aggressive, and advanced to
attack Nikostratus, who retreated before them, but backing astern and
keeping the head of his ships towards the enemy. In this manner he
succeeded in drawing them away from the town, so as to leave to most
of the Korkyræan ships opportunity for getting back to the harbor;
while such was the superior manœuvring of the Athenian triremes,
that the Peloponnesians were never able to come up with him or force
him to action. They returned back in the evening to Sybota, with no
greater triumph<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[p. 274]</span>
than their success against the Korkyræans, thirteen of whose triremes
they carried away as prizes.<a id="FNanchor_459" href="#Footnote_459"
class="fnanchor">[459]</a></p>

<p>It was the expectation in Korkyra, that they would on the morrow
make a direct attack—which could hardly have failed of success—on the
town and harbor; and we may easily believe (what report afterwards
stated), that Brasidas advised Alkidas to this decisive proceeding.
And the Korkyræan leaders, more terrified than ever, first removed
their prisoners from the little island to the Heræum, and then tried
to come to a compromise with the oligarchical party generally,
for the purpose of organizing some effective and united defence.
Thirty triremes were made ready and manned, wherein some even of the
oligarchical Korkyræans were persuaded to form part of the crews.
But the slackness of Alkidas proved their best defence: instead of
coming straight to the town, he contented himself with landing in
the island at some distance from it, on the promontory of Leukimnê:
after ravaging the neighboring lands for some hours, he returned to
his station at Sybota. He had lost an opportunity which never again
returned: for on the very same night the fire-signals of Leukas
telegraphed to him the approach of the fleet under Eurymedon from
Athens,—sixty triremes. His only thought was now for the escape of
the Peloponnesian fleet, which was in fact saved by this telegraphic
notice. Advantage was taken of the darkness to retire close along
the land as far as the isthmus which separates Leukas from the
mainland,—across which isthmus the ships were dragged by hand or
machinery, so that they might not fall in with or be descried by
the Athenian fleet in sailing round the Leukadian promontory.
From hence Alkidas made the best of his way home to Peloponnesus,
leaving the Korkyræan oligarchs to their fate.<a id="FNanchor_460"
href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a></p>

<p>That fate was deplorable in the extreme. The arrival of
Eurymedon opens a third unexpected transition in this checkered
narrative,—the Korkyræan Demos passing, abruptly and unexpectedly,
from intense alarm and helplessness to elate and irresistible
mastery. In the bosom of Greeks, and in a population seemingly
amongst the least refined of all Greeks,—including too a great many
slaves just emancipated against the will of<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_275">[p. 275]</span> their masters, and of course the
fiercest and most discontented of all the slaves in the island,—such
a change was but too sure to kindle a thirst for revenge almost
ungovernable, as the only compensation for foregone terror and
suffering. As soon as the Peloponnesian fleet was known to have
fled, and that of Eurymedon was seen approaching, the Korkyræan
leaders brought into the town the five hundred Messenian hoplites
who had hitherto been encamped without; thus providing a resource
against any last effort of despair on the part of their interior
enemies. Next, the thirty ships recently manned,—and held ready, in
the harbor facing the continent, to go out against the Peloponnesian
fleet, but now no longer needed, were ordered to sail round to the
other or Hyllaic harbor. Even while they were thus sailing round,
some obnoxious men of the defeated party, being seen in public, were
slain: but when the ships arrived at the Hyllaic harbor, and the
crews were disembarked, a more wholesale massacre was perpetrated, by
singling out those individuals of the oligarchical faction who had
been persuaded on the day before to go aboard as part of the crews,
and putting them to death.<a id="FNanchor_461" href="#Footnote_461"
class="fnanchor">[461]</a> Then came the fate of those suppliants,
about four hundred in number, who had been brought back from the
islet opposite, and were yet under sanctuary in the sacred precinct
of the Heræum. It was proposed to them to quit sanctuary and stand
their trial; and fifty of them having accepted the proposition, were
put on their trial,—all condemned, and all executed. Their execution
took place, as it seems, immediately on the spot, and within actual
view of the unhappy men still remaining in the sacred ground;<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[p. 276]</span><a id="FNanchor_462"
href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a> who, seeing that
their lot was desperate, preferred dying by their own hands to
starvation or the sword of their enemies. Some hung themselves on
branches of the trees surrounding the temple, others helped their
friends in the work of suicide, and, in one way or another, the
entire band thus perished: it was probably a consolation to them to
believe, that this desecration of the precinct would bring down the
anger of the gods upon their surviving enemies.</p>

<p>Eurymedon remained with his fleet for seven days, during all which
time the victorious Korkyræans carried on a sanguinary persecution
against the party who had been concerned in the late oligarchical
revolution. Five hundred of this party contrived to escape by flight
to the mainland; while those who did not, or could not flee, were
slain wherever they could be found. Some received their death-wounds
even on the altar itself,—others shared the same fate, after having
been dragged away from it by violence. In one case, a party of
murderers having pursued their victims to the temple of Dionysius,
refrained from shedding their blood, but built up the doorway and
left them to starve; as the Lacedæmonians had done on a former
occasion respecting Pausanias. Such was the ferocity of the time,
that in one case a father slew his own son. Nor was it merely the
oligarchical party who thus suffered: the floodgates of private feud
were also opened, and various individuals, under false charges of
having been concerned in the oligarchical movements, were slain by
personal enemies or debtors. This deplorable suspension of legal, as
well as moral restraints, continued during the week of Eurymedon’s
stay,—a period long enough to satiate the fierce sentiment out
of which it arose;<a id="FNanchor_463" href="#Footnote_463"
class="fnanchor">[463]</a> yet without any apparent effort on his
part to soften the victors or protect the vanquished. We shall
see farther reason hereafter to appreciate the baseness and want
of humanity in his character: but had Nikostratus remained in
command, we may fairly presume, judging by what he had done in the
earlier part of the sedition, with very inferior force, that he
would have set much earlier limits to the Kor<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_277">[p. 277]</span>kyræan butchery: unfortunately,
Thucydidês tells us nothing at all about Nikostratus, after the naval
battle of the preceding day.<a id="FNanchor_464" href="#Footnote_464"
class="fnanchor">[464]</a></p>

<p>We should have been glad to hear something about the steps taken
in the way of restoration or healing, after this burst of murderous
fury, in which doubtless the newly-emancipated slaves were not
the most backward, and after the departure of Eurymedon. But here
again Thucydidês disappoints our curiosity. We only hear from him,
that the oligarchical exiles who had escaped to the mainland were
strong enough to get possession of the forts and most part of the
territory there belonging to Korkyra; just as the exiles from Samos
and Mitylênê became more or less completely masters of the Peræa
or mainland possessions belonging to those islands. They even sent
envoys to Corinth and Sparta, in hopes of procuring aid to accomplish
their restoration by force, but their request found no favor, and
they were reduced to their own resources. After harassing for some
time the Korkyræans in the island by predatory incursions, so as to
produce considerable dearth and distress, they at length collected a
band of Epirotic mercenaries, passed over to the island, and<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[p. 278]</span> there established a
fortified position on the mountain called Istônê, not far from the
city. They burned their vessels in order to cut off all hopes of
retreat, and maintained themselves for near two years on a system
of ravage and plunder which inflicted great misery on the island.<a
id="FNanchor_465" href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a>
This was a frequent way whereby, of old, invaders wore out and
mastered a city, the walls of which they found impregnable. The
ultimate fate of these occupants of Istônê, which belongs to a <a
href="#Istone">future chapter</a>, will be found to constitute a
close suitable to the bloody drama yet unfinished in Korkyra.</p>

<p>Such a drama could not be acted, in an important city belonging
to the Greek name, without producing a deep and extensive impression
throughout all the other cities. And Thucydidês has taken advantage
of it to give a sort of general sketch of Grecian politics during
the Peloponnesian war; violence of civil discord in each city,
aggravated by foreign war, and by the contending efforts of Athens
and Sparta,—the former espousing the democratical party everywhere;
the latter, the oligarchical. The Korkyræan sedition was the
first case in which these two causes of political antipathy and
exasperation were seen acting with full united force, and where
the malignity of sentiment and demoralization flowing from such an
union was seen without disguise. The picture drawn by Thucydidês,
of moral and political feeling under these influences, will ever
remain memorable as the work of an analyst and a philosopher: he
has conceived and described the perverting causes with a spirit
of generalization which renders these two chapters hardly less
applicable to other political societies, far distant both in time and
place,—especially, under many points of view, to France between 1789
and 1799,—than to Greece in the fifth century before the Christian
era. The deadly bitterness infused into intestine party contests
by the accompanying dangers of foreign war and intervention of
foreign enemies,—the mutual fears between political rivals, where
each thinks that the other will forestall him in striking a mortal
blow, and where constitutional maxims have ceased to carry authority
either as restraint or as protection,—the superior popularity of
the man who is most forward with the sword, or who runs down<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[p. 279]</span> his enemies in the
most unmeasured language, coupled with the disposition to treat
both prudence in action and candor in speech as if it were nothing
but treachery or cowardice,—the exclusive regard to party ends,
with the reckless adoption, and even admiring preference, of fraud
or violence as the most effectual means,—the loss of respect for
legal authority, as well as of confidence in private agreement,
and the surrender even of blood and friendship to the overruling
ascendency of party-ties,—the perversion of ordinary morality,
bringing with it altered signification of all the common words
importing blame or approbation,—the unnatural predominance of the
ambitious and contentious passions, overpowering in men’s minds
all real public objects, and equalizing for the time the better
and the worse cause, by taking hold of democracy on one side and
aristocracy on the other as mere pretences to sanctify personal
triumph,—all these gloomy social phenomena, here indicated by the
historian, have their causes deeply seated in the human mind, and
are likely, unless the bases of constitutional morality shall come
to be laid more surely and firmly than they have hitherto been, to
recur from time to time, under diverse modifications, “so long as
human nature shall be the same as it is now,” to use the language
of Thucydidês himself.<a id="FNanchor_466" href="#Footnote_466"
class="fnanchor">[466]</a> He has described, with fidelity not<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[p. 280]</span> inferior to his sketch
of the pestilence at Athens, the symptoms of a certain morbid
political condition, wherein the vehemence<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_281">[p. 281]</span> of intestine conflict, instead of being
kept within such limits as consists with the maintenance of one
society among the contending parties, becomes for the time inflamed
and poisoned with all the unscrupulous hostility of foreign war,
chiefly from actual alliance between parties within the state and
foreigners without. In following the impressive description of the
historian, we have to keep in mind the general state of manners in
his time, especially the cruelties tolerated by the laws of war, as
compared with that greater humanity and respect for life which has
grown up during the last two centuries in modern Europe. And we have
farther to recollect that if he had been describing the effects of
political fury among Carthaginians and Jews, instead of among his
contemporary Greeks, he would have added to his list of horrors
mutilation, crucifixion, and other refinements on simple murder.</p>

<p>The language of Thucydidês is to be taken rather as a
generalization and concentration of phenomena which he had observed
among different communities, rather than as belonging altogether to
any one of them. Nor are we to believe—what a superficial reading
of his opening words might at first suggest—that the bloodshed in
Korkyra was only the earliest, but by no means the worst, of a series
of similar horrors spread over the Grecian world. The facts stated
in his own history suffice to show that though the same causes
which worked upon this unfortunate island became disseminated, and
produced analogous mischiefs throughout many other communities,
yet the case of Korkyra, as it was the first, so it was also the
worst and most aggravated in point of intensity. Fortunately, the
account of Thucydidês enables us to understand it from beginning
to end, and to appreciate the degree of guilt of the various
parties implicated, which we can seldom do with certainty; because
when once the interchange of violence has begun, the feelings
arising out of the contest itself presently overpower in the minds
of both parties the original cause of dispute, as well as all
scruples<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[p. 282]</span> as to
fitness of means. Unjustifiable acts in abundance are committed by
both, and in comparing the two, we are often obliged to employ the
emphatic language which Tacitus uses respecting Otho and Vitellius:
“Deteriorem fore, quisquis vicisset;” of two bad men, all that the
Roman world could foresee was, that the victor, whichsoever he was,
would prove the worst.</p>

<p>But in regard to the Korkyræan revolution, we can arrive at a more
discriminating criticism. We see that it is from the beginning the
work of a selfish oligarchical party, playing the game of a foreign
enemy, and the worst and most ancient enemy of the island,—aiming to
subvert the existing democracy and acquire power for themselves, and
ready to employ any measure of fraud or violence for the attainment
of these objects. While the democracy which they attack is purely
defensive and conservative, the oligarchical movers, having tried
fair means in vain, are the first to employ foul means, which
latter they find retorted with greater effect against themselves.
They set the example of judicial prosecution against Peithias, for
the destruction of a political antagonist; in the use of this same
weapon, he proves more than a match for them, and employs it to their
ruin. Next, they pass to the use of the dagger in the senate-house,
against him and his immediate fellow-leaders, and to the wholesale
application of the sword against the democracy generally. The
Korkyræan Demos are thus thrown upon the defensive, and instead of
the affections of ordinary life, all the most intense anti-social
sentiments,—fear, pugnacity, hatred, vengeance, obtain unqualified
possession of their bosoms; exaggerated too through the fluctuations
of victory and defeat successively brought by Nikostratus, Alkidas,
and Eurymedon. Their conduct as victors is such as we should expect
under such maddening circumstances, from coarse men, mingled with
liberated slaves: it is vindictive and murderous in the extreme, not
without faithless breach of assurances given. But we must remember
that they are driven to stand upon their defence, and that all their
energies are indispensable to make that defence successful. They
are provoked by an aggression no less guilty in the end than in
the means,—an aggression, too, the more gratuitous, because, if we
look at the state of the island at the time when the oligarchical
captives<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[p. 283]</span> were
restored from Corinth, there was no pretence for affirming that it
had suffered, or was suffering, any loss, hardship, or disgrace, from
its alliance with Athens. These oligarchical insurgents find the
island in a state of security and tranquillity,—since the war imposed
upon it little necessity for effort,—they plunge it into a sea of
blood, with enormities as well as suffering on both sides, which end
at length in their own complete extermination. Our compassion for
their final misery must not hinder us from appreciating the behavior
whereby it was earned.</p>

<p>In the course of a few years from this time, we shall have
occasion to recount two political movements in Athens, similar in
principle and general result to this Korkyræan revolution; exhibiting
oligarchical conspirators against an existing and conservative
democracy, with this conspiracy at first successful, but afterwards
put down, and the Demos again restored. The contrast between
Athens and Korkyra, under such circumstances, will be found highly
instructive, especially in regard to the Demos, both in the hours of
defeat and in those of victory. It will then be seen how much the
habit of active participation in political and judicial affairs,—of
open, conflicting discussion, discharging the malignant passions
by way of speech, and followed by appeal to the vote,—of having
constantly present, to the mind of every citizen, in his character of
dikast or ekklesiast, the conditions of a pacific society, and the
paramount authority of a constitutional majority,—how much all these
circumstances, brought home as they were at Athens more than in any
other democracy to the feelings of individuals, contributed to soften
the instincts of intestine violence and revenge, even under very
great provocation.</p>

<p>But the case of Korkyra, as well as that of Athens, different
in so many respects, conspire to illustrate another truth, of much
importance in Grecian history. Both of them show how false and
impudent were the pretensions set up by the rich and great men of the
various Grecian cities, to superior morality, superior intelligence,
and greater fitness for using honorably and beneficially the powers
of government, as compared with the mass of the citizens. Though
the Grecian oligarchies, exercising powerful sway over fashion,
and more especially over the meaning of<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_284">[p. 284]</span> words, bestowed upon themselves the
appellation of “the best men, the honorable and good, the elegant,
the superior,” etc., and attached to those without their own circle
epithets of a contrary tenor, implying low moral attributes,—no such
difference will be found borne out by the facts of Grecian history.<a
id="FNanchor_467" href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a>
Abundance of infirmity, with occasional bad passions, was doubtless
liable to work upon the people generally, often corrupting and
misguiding even the Athenian democracy, the best apparently of all
the democracies in Greece. But after all, the rich and great men
were only a part of the people, and taking them as a class, apart
from honorable individual exceptions, by no means the best part. If
exempted by their position from some of the vices which beset smaller
and poorer men, they imbibed from that same position an unmeasured
self-importance, and an excess of personal ambition as well as of
personal appetite, peculiar to themselves, not less anti-social in
tendency, and operating upon a much grander scale. To the prejudices
and superstitions belonging to the age, they were noway superior,
considering them as a class; while their animosities among one
another, virulent and unscrupulous, were among the foremost causes
of misfortune in Grecian commonwealth,—and indeed many of the most
exceptionable acts committed by the democracies, consisted in their
allowing themselves to be made the tools of one aristocrat for the
ruin of another. Of the intense party-selfishness which characterized
them as a body, sometimes exaggerated into the strongest
anti-popular antipathy, as we see in the famous oligarchical oath
cited by Aristotle,<a id="FNanchor_468" href="#Footnote_468"
class="fnanchor">[468]</a> we shall find many illustrations as we
advance in the history, but none more striking than this Korkyræan
revolution.</p>

    FROM THE TROUBLES IN KORKYRA, IN THE FIFTH YEAR OF THE
    PELOPONNESIAN WAR, DOWN TO THE END OF THE SIXTH YEAR.</h2>
</div>

<p class="ti0"><span class="smcap">About</span> the same time as
the troubles of Korkyra occurred, Nikias, the Athenian general,
conducted an armament against the rocky island of Minôa, which
lay at the mouth of the harbor of Megara, and was occupied by a
Megarian fort and garrison. The narrow channel, which separated
it from the Megarian port of Nisæa, and formed the entrance of
the harbor, was defended by two towers projecting out from Nisæa,
which Nikias attacked and destroyed by means of battering machines
from his ships. He thus cut off Minôa from communication on that
side with the Megarians, and fortified it on the other side, where
it communicated with the mainland by a lagoon bridged over with
a causeway. Minôa, thus becoming thoroughly insulated, was more
completely fortified and made an Athenian possession; since it was
eminently convenient to keep up an effective blockade against the
Megarian harbor, which the Athenians had hitherto done only from the
opposite shore of Salamis.<a id="FNanchor_469" href="#Footnote_469"
class="fnanchor">[469]</a></p>

<p>Though Nikias, son of Nikeratus, had been for some time
conspicuous in public life, and is said to have been more than
once stratêgus along with Periklês, this is the first occasion on
which Thucydidês introduces him to our notice. He was now one of
the stratêgi, or generals of the commonwealth, and appears to have
enjoyed, on the whole, a greater and more constant personal esteem
than any citizen of Athens, from the present time down to his
death. In wealth and in family he ranked among the first class of
Athenians: in political character, Aristotle placed him, together
with Thucydidês son of Melêsias and Theramenês, above all other
names in Athenian history,—seemingly even<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_286">[p. 286]</span> above Periklês.<a id="FNanchor_470"
href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a> Such a criticism,
from Aristotle, deserves respectful attention, though the facts
before us completely belie so lofty an estimate. It marks, however,
the position occupied by Nikias in Athenian politics, as the
principal person of what maybe called the oligarchical party,
succeeding Kimon and Thucydidês, and preceding Theramenês. In looking
to the conditions under which this party continued to subsist, we
shall see that, during the interval between Thucydidês (son of
Melêsias) and Nikias, the democratical forms had acquired such
confirmed ascendency, that it would not have suited the purpose of
any politician to betray evidence of positive hostility to them,
prior to the Sicilian expedition, and the great embarrassment in the
foreign relations of Athens which arose out of that disaster. After
that change, the Athenian oligarchs became emboldened and aggressive,
so that we shall find Theramenês among the chief conspirators in
the revolution of the Four Hundred: but Nikias represents the
oligarchical party in its previous state of quiescence and torpidity,
accommodating itself to a sovereign democracy, and existing in the
form of common sentiment rather than of common purposes. And it is a
remarkable illustration of the real temper of the Athenian people,
that a man of this character, known as an oligarch but not feared
as such, and doing his duty sincerely to the democracy, should have
remained until his death the most esteemed and influential man in
the city. He was a man of a sort of even mediocrity, in intellect,
in education, and in oratory: forward in his military duties, and
not only personally courageous in the field, but also competent
as a general under ordinary circumstances:<a id="FNanchor_471"
href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a> assiduous in the
discharge of all political duties at home, especially in the post
of stratêgus, or one of the ten generals of the state, to which he
was frequently chosen and rechosen. Of the many valuable qualities
combined in his predecessor Periklês, the recollection of whom was
yet fresh in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[p. 287]</span>
the Athenian mind, Nikias possessed two, on which, most of all his
influence rested,—though, properly speaking, that influence belongs
to the sum total of his character, and not to any special attributes
in it: First, he was thoroughly incorruptible, as to pecuniary
gains,—a quality so rare in Grecian public men of all the cities,
that when a man once became notorious for possessing it, he acquired
a greater degree of trust than any superiority of intellect could
have bestowed upon him: next, he adopted the Periklêan view as to
the necessity of a conservative or stationary foreign policy for
Athens, and of avoiding new acquisitions at a distance, adventurous
risks, or provocation to fresh enemies. With this important point of
analogy, there were at the same time material differences between
them, even in regard to foreign policy. Periklês was a conservative,
resolute against submitting to loss or abstraction of empire,
as well as refraining from aggrandizement: Nikias was in policy
faint-hearted, averse to energetic effort for any purpose whatever,
and disposed, not only to maintain peace, but even to purchase it by
considerable sacrifices. Nevertheless, he was the leading champion
of the conservative party of his day, always powerful at Athens: and
as he was constantly familiar with the details and actual course
of public affairs, capable of giving full effect to the cautious
and prudential point of view, and enjoying unqualified credit for
honest purposes,—his value as a permanent counsellor was steadily
recognized, even though in particular cases his counsel might not be
followed.</p>

<p>Besides these two main points, which Nikias had in common with
Periklês, he was perfect in the use of those minor and collateral
modes of standing well with the people, which that great man had
taken little pains to practise. While Periklês attached himself
to Aspasia, whose splendid qualities did not redeem, in the eyes
of the public, either her foreign origin or her unchastity, the
domestic habits of Nikias appear to have been strictly conformable
to the rules of Athenian decorum. Periklês was surrounded by
philosophers, Nikias by prophets,—whose advice was necessary both as
a consolation to his temperament, and as a guide to his intelligence
under difficulties; one of them was constantly in his service and
confidence, and his conduct appears to have been sensibly affected
by the difference of character between<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_288">[p. 288]</span> one prophet and another,<a
id="FNanchor_472" href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a>
just as the government of Louis the Fourteenth, and other Catholic
princes, has been modified by the change of confessors. To a life
thus rigidly decorous and ultra-religious—both eminently acceptable
to the Athenians—Nikias added the judicious employment of a large
fortune with a view to popularity. Those liturgies—or expensive
public duties undertaken by rich men each in his turn, throughout
other cities of Greece as well as in Athens—which fell to his lot
were performed with such splendor, munificence, and good taste,
as to procure for him universal encomiums; and so much above his
predecessors as to be long remembered and extolled. Most of these
liturgies were connected with the religious service of the state,
so that Nikias, by his manner of performing them, displayed his
zeal for the honor of the gods at the same time that he laid up for
himself a store of popularity. Moreover, the remarkable caution
and timidity—not before an enemy, but in reference to his own
fellow-citizens—which marked his character, rendered him preëminently
scrupulous as to giving offence or making personal enemies. While
his demeanor towards the poorer citizens generally was equal and
conciliating, the presents which he made were numerous, both to gain
friends and to silence assailants. We are not surprised to hear that
various bullies, whom the comic writers turn to scorn, made their
profit out of this susceptibility,—but most assuredly Nikias as a
public man, though he might occasionally be cheated out of money, was
greatly assisted by the reputation which he thus acquired.</p>

<p>The expenses unavoidable in such a career, combined with strict
personal honesty, could not have been defrayed except by another
quality, which ought not to count as discreditable to Nikias,
though in this too he stood distinguished from Periklês. He was
a careful and diligent money-getter; a speculator in the silver
mines of Laurium, and proprietor of one thousand slaves, whom
he let out for work in them, receiving a fixed sum per head for
each: the superintending slaves who managed the details of<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[p. 289]</span> this business were
men of great ability and high pecuniary value.<a id="FNanchor_473"
href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a> Most of the wealth
of Nikias was held in this form, and not in landed property. Judging
by what remains to us of the comic authors, this must have been
considered as a perfectly gentlemanlike way of making money: for
while they abound with derision of the leather-dresser Kleon, the
lamp-maker Hyperbolus, and the vegetable-selling mother to whom
Euripidês owes his birth, we hear nothing from them in disparagement
of the slave-letter Nikias. The degree to which the latter was thus
occupied with the care of his private fortune, together with the
general moderation of his temper, made him often wish to abstract
himself from public duty: but such unambitious reluctance, rare
among the public men of the day, rather made the Athenians more
anxious to put him forward and retain his services. In the eyes of
the Pentakosiomedimni and the Hippeis, the two richest classes in
Athens, he was one of themselves,—and on the whole, the best man, as
being so little open to reproach or calumny, whom they could oppose
to the leather-dressers and lamp-makers who often out-talked them in
the public assembly. The hoplites, who despised Kleon,—and did not
much regard even the brave, hardy, and soldierlike Lamachus, because
he happened to be poor,<a id="FNanchor_474" href="#Footnote_474"
class="fnanchor">[474]</a>—respected in Nikias the union of wealth
and family with honesty, courage, and carefulness in command. The
maritime and trading multitude esteemed him as a decorous, honest,
religious gentleman, who gave splendid choregies, treated the poorest
men with consideration, and never turned the public service into a
job for his own profit,—who, moreover, if he possessed no commanding
qualities, so as to give to his advice imperative and irresistible
authority, was yet always worthy of being consulted, and a steady
safeguard against public mischief. Before the fatal Sicilian
expedition, he had never commanded on any very serious or difficult
enterprise, but what he had done had been accomplished successfully;
so that he enjoyed the reputation of a for<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_290">[p. 290]</span>tunate as well as a prudent commander.<a
id="FNanchor_475" href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a> He
appears to have acted as proxenus to the Lacedæmonians at Athens;
probably by his own choice, and among several others.</p>

<p>The first half of the political life of Nikias,—after the time
when he rose to enjoy full consideration in Athens, being already
of mature age,—was spent in opposition to Kleon; the last half,
in opposition to Alkibiadês. To employ terms which are not fully
suitable to the Athenian democracy, but which yet bring to view
the difference intended to be noted better than any others, Nikias
was a minister or ministerial man, often actually exercising and
always likely to exercise official functions,—Kleon was a man of
the opposition, whose province it was to supervise and censure
official men for their public conduct. We must divest these words of
that sense which they are understood to carry in English political
life,—a standing parliamentary majority in favor of one party:
Kleon would often carry in the public assembly resolutions, which
his opponents Nikias and others of like rank and position,—who
served in the posts of stratêgus, ambassador, and other important
offices designated by the general vote, were obliged against their
will to execute. In attaining such offices they were assisted by
the political clubs, or established <i>conspiracies</i> (to translate
the original literally), among the leading Athenians, to stand by
each other both for acquisition of office and for mutual insurance
under judicial trial. These clubs, or hetæries, must without
doubt have played a most important part in the practical working
of Athenian politics, and it is much to be regretted that we are
possessed of no details respecting them. We know that in Athens they
were thoroughly oligarchical in disposition,<a id="FNanchor_476"
href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a>—while equality, or
something near to it, in rank<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[p.
291]</span> and position must have been essential to the social
harmony of the members: in some towns, it appears that such political
associations existed under the form of gymnasia,<a id="FNanchor_477"
href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a> for the mutual
exercise of the members, or of syssitia for joint banquets. At Athens
they were numerous, and doubtless not habitually in friendship with
each other, since the antipathies among different oligarchical men
were exceedingly strong, and the union brought about between them
at the time of the Four Hundred arose only out of common desire
to put down the democracy, and lasted but a little while. But
the designation of persons to serve in the capacity of stratêgus
and other principal offices greatly depended upon them,—as well
as the facility of passing through that trial of accountability
to which every man was liable after his year of office. Nikias,
and men generally of his rank and fortune, helped by these clubs,
and lending help in their turn, composed what may be called the
ministers, or executive individual functionaries of Athens: the men
who acted, gave orders to individual men as to<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_292">[p. 292]</span> specific acts, and saw to the execution
of that which the senate and the public assembly resolved. Especially
in regard to the military and naval force of the city, so large and
so actively employed at this time, the powers of detail possessed by
the stratêgi must have been very great and essential to the safety of
the state.</p>

<p>While Nikias was thus in what may be called ministerial function,
Kleon was not of sufficient importance to attain the same, but
was confined to the inferior function of opposition: we shall see
in the coming chapter how he became as it were promoted, partly
by his own superior penetration, partly by the dishonest artifice
and misjudgment of Nikias and other opponents, in the affair of
Sphakteria. But his vocation was now to find fault, to censure, to
denounce; his theatre of action was the senate, the public assembly,
the dikasteries; his principal talent was that of speech, in which he
must unquestionably have surpassed all his contemporaries. The two
gifts which had been united in Periklês—superior capacity for speech
as well as for action—were now severed, and had fallen, though both
in greatly inferior degree, the one to Nikias, the other to Kleon. As
an opposition-man, fierce and violent in temper, Kleon was extremely
formidable to all acting functionaries; and from his influence in
the public assembly, he was doubtless the author of many important
positive measures, thus going beyond the functions belonging to what
is called opposition. But though the most effective speaker in the
public assembly, he was not for that reason the most influential
person in the democracy: his powers of speech in fact, stood out the
more prominently, because they were found apart from that station,
and those qualities which were considered, even at Athens, all but
essential to make a man a leader in political life. To understand the
political condition of Athens at this time, it has been necessary to
take this comparison between Nikias and Kleon, and to remark, that
though the latter might be a more victorious speaker, the former was
the more guiding and influential leader; the points gained by Kleon
were all noisy and palpable, sometimes however, without doubt, of
considerable moment,—but the course of affairs was much more under
the direction of Nikias.</p>

<p>It was during the summer of this year, the fifth of the war,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[p. 293]</span>—<small>B.C.</small>
427, that the Athenians began operations on a small scale in Sicily;
probably contrary to the advice both of Nikias and Kleon, neither of
them seemingly favorable to these distant undertakings. I reserve,
however, the series of Athenian measures in Sicily—which afterwards
became the turning-point of the fortunes of the state—for a
department by themselves. I shall take them up separately, and bring
them down to the Athenian expedition against Syracuse, when I reach
the date of that important event.</p>

<p>During the autumn of the same year, the epidemic disorder, after
having intermitted for some time, resumed its ravages at Athens,
and continued for one whole year longer, to the sad ruin both of
the strength and the comfort of the city. And it seems that this
autumn, as well as the ensuing summer, were distinguished by violent
atmospheric and terrestrial disturbance. Numerous earthquakes
were experienced at Athens, in Eubœa, in Bœotia, especially near
Orchomenus. Sudden waves of the sea and unexampled tides were also
felt on the coast of Eubœa and Lokris, and the islands of Atalantê
and Peparêthus; the Athenian fort and one of the two guard-ships
at Atalantê were partially destroyed. The earthquakes produced one
effect favorable to Athens; they deterred the Lacedæmonians from
invading Attica. Agis, king of Sparta, had already reached the
isthmus for that purpose; but the repeated earthquakes were looked
upon as an unfavorable portent, and the scheme was abandoned.<a
id="FNanchor_478" href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a></p>

<p>These earthquakes, however, were not considered as calculated
to deter the Lacedæmonians from the foundation of Herakleia, a new
colony near the strait of Thermopylæ. On this occasion, we hear of
a branch of the Greek population not before mentioned during the
war. The coast immediately north of the strait of Thermopylæ was
occupied by the three subdivisions of the Malians,—Paralii, Hierês,
and Trachinians. These latter, immediately adjoining Mount Œta on
its north side,—as well as the Dorians, the little tribe properly
so called, which was accounted the primitive hearth of the Dorians
generally, who joined the same mountain-range on the south,—were both
of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[p. 294]</span> them harassed
and plundered by the predatory mountaineers, probably Ætolians, on
the high lands between them. At first, the Trachinians were disposed
to throw themselves on the protection of Athens; but not feeling
sufficiently assured as to the way in which she would deal with them,
they joined with the Dorians in claiming aid from Sparta: in fact,
it does not appear that Athens, possessing naval superiority only,
and being inferior on land, could have given them effective aid.
The Lacedæmonians eagerly embraced the opportunity, and determined
to plant a strong colony in this tempting situation: there was wood
in the neighboring regions for ship-building,<a id="FNanchor_479"
href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a> so that they might
hope to acquire a naval position for attacking the neighboring island
of Eubœa, while the passage of troops against the subject-allies of
Athens in Thrace, would also be facilitated; the impracticability of
such passage had forced them, three years before, to leave Potidæa to
its fate. A considerable body of colonists, Spartans and Lacedæmonian
Periœki, was assembled under the conduct of three Spartan
œkists,—Leon, Damagon, and Alkidas; the latter we are to presume,
though Thucydidês does not say so, was the same admiral who had met
with such little success in Ionia and at Korkyra. Proclamation was
farther made to invite the junction of all other Greeks as colonists,
excepting by name Ionians, Achæans, and some other tribes not here
specified. Probably the distinct exclusion of the Achæans must have
been rather the continuance of ancient sentiment than dictated by any
present reasons; since the Achæans were not now pronounced enemies of
Sparta. A number of colonists, stated as not less than ten thousand,
flocked to the place, having confidence in the stability of the
colony under the powerful protection of Sparta; and a new town, of
large circuit, was built and fortified under the name of Herakleia;<a
id="FNanchor_480" href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a> not
far from the site of Trachis, about two miles and a quarter from the
nearest point of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[p. 295]</span>
the Maliac gulf, but about double that distance from the strait
of Thermopylæ. Near to the latter, and for the purpose of keeping
effective possession of it, a port, with dock and accommodation for
shipping, was constructed.</p>

<p>A populous city, established under Lacedæmonian protection in this
important post, alarmed the Athenians, and created much expectation
in every part of Greece: but the Lacedæmonian œkists were harsh and
unskilful in their management, and the Thessalians, to whom the
Trachinian territory was tributary, considered the colony as an
encroachment upon their soil. Anxious to prevent its increase, they
harassed it with hostilities from the first moment, while the Œtæan
assailants were not idle: and Herakleia, thus pressed from without,
and misgoverned within, dwindled down from its original numbers
and promise, barely maintaining its existence.<a id="FNanchor_481"
href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a> We shall find it in
later times, however, revived, and becoming a place of considerable
importance.</p>

<p>The main Athenian armament of this summer, consisting of sixty
triremes, under Nikias, undertook an expedition against the island
of Melos. Melos and Thera, both inhabited by ancient colonists from
Lacedæmon, had never been from the beginning, and still refused to
be, members of the Athenian alliance, or subjects of the Athenian
empire. They thus stood out as exceptions to all the other islands
in the Ægean, and the Athenians thought themselves authorized to
resort to constraint and conquest; believing themselves entitled
to command over all the islands. They might indeed urge, and with
considerable plausibility, that the Melians now enjoyed their share
of the protection of the Ægean from piracy, without contributing at
all to the cost of it: but considering the obstinate reluctance and
strong Lacedæmonian prepossessions of the Melians, who had taken
no part in the war, and given no ground of offence to Athens, the
attempt to conquer them by force could hardly be justified even as
a calculation of gain and loss, and was a mere gratification to
the pride of power in carrying out what, in modern days, we should
call the principle of maritime empire. Melos and Thera formed
awkward corners, which defaced the symmetry of a great propri<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[p. 296]</span>etor’s field;<a
id="FNanchor_482" href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a>
and the former ultimately entailed upon Athens the heaviest of all
losses,—a deed of blood which deeply dishonored her annals. On this
occasion, Nikias visited the island with his fleet, and after vainly
summoning the inhabitants, ravaged the lands, but retired without
undertaking a siege. He then sailed away, and came to Orôpus, on the
northeast frontier of Attica, bordering on Bœotia: the hoplites on
board his ships landed in the night, and marched into the interior
of Bœotia, to the vicinity of Tanagra. They were here met, according
to signal raised, by a military force from Athens, which marched
thither by land; and the joint Athenian army ravaged the Tanagræan
territory, gaining an insignificant advantage over its defenders. On
retiring, Nikias reassembled his armament, sailed northward along the
coast of Lokris with the usual ravages, and returned home without
effecting anything farther.<a id="FNanchor_483" href="#Footnote_483"
class="fnanchor">[483]</a></p>

<p>About the same time that he started, thirty other Athenian
triremes, under Demosthenês and Proklês, had been sent round
Peloponnesus to act upon the coast of Akarnania. In conjunction
with the whole Akarnanian force, except the men of Œniade,—with
fifteen triremes from Korkyra, and some troops from Kephallênia and
Zakynthus,—they ravaged the whole territory of Leukas, both within
and without the isthmus, and confined the inhabitants to their
town, which was too strong to be taken by anything but a wall of
circumvallation and a tedious blockade. And the Akarnanians, to whom
the city was especially hostile, were urgent with Demosthenês to
undertake this measure forthwith, since the opportunity might not
again recur, and success was nearly certain.</p>

<p>But this enterprising officer committed the grave imprudence of
offending them on a matter of great importance, in order to attack a
country of all others the most impracticable,—the interior of Ætolia.
The Messenians of Naupaktus, who suffered from the depredations
of the neighboring Ætolian tribes, inflamed his imagination by
suggesting to him a grand scheme of opera<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_297">[p. 297]</span>tions,<a id="FNanchor_484"
href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a> more worthy of the
large force which he commanded than the mere reduction of Leukas.
The various tribes of Ætolians,—rude, brave, active, predatory, and
unrivalled in the use of the javelin, which they rarely laid out of
their hands,—stretched across the country from between Parnassus
and Œta to the eastern bank of the Achelôus. The scheme suggested
by the Messenians was, that Demosthenês should attack the great
central Ætolian tribes,—the Apodôti, Ophioneis, and Eurytânes: if
they were conquered, all the remaining continental tribes between
the Ambrakian gulf and Mount Parnassus might be invited or forced
into the alliance of Athens,—the Akarnanians being already included
in it. Having thus got the command of a large continental force,<a
id="FNanchor_485" href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a>
Demosthenês contemplated the ulterior scheme of marching at the
head of it on the west of Parnassus, through the territory of the
Ozolian Lokrians,—inhabiting the north of the Corinthian gulf,
friendly to Athens, and enemies to the Ætolians, whom they resembled
both in their habits and in their fighting,—until he arrived at
Kytinium, in Doris, in the upper portion of the valley of the
river Kephisus. He would then easily descend that valley into the
territory of the Phocians, who were likely to join the Athenians
if a favorable opportunity occurred, but who might at any rate be
constrained to do so. From Phocis, the scheme was to invade from
the northward the conterminous territory of Bœotia, the great enemy
of Athens: which might thus perhaps be completely subdued, if
assailed at the same time from Attica. Any Athenian general, who
could have executed this comprehensive scheme, would have acquired
at home a high and well-merited celebrity. But Demosthenês had been
ill-informed, both of the invincible barbarians and the pathless
country comprehended under the name of Ætolia: some of<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[p. 298]</span> the tribes spoke a
language scarcely intelligible to Greeks, and even eat their meat
raw, while the country has even down to the present time remained not
only unconquered, but untraversed, by an enemy in arms.</p>

<p>Demosthenês accordingly retired from Leukas, in spite of the
remonstrance of the Akarnanians, who not only could not be induced
to accompany him, but went home in visible disgust, He then sailed
with his other forces—Messenians, Kephallenians, and Zakynthians—to
Œneon, in the territory of the Ozolian Lokrians, a maritime township
on the Corinthian gulf, not far eastward of Naupaktus,—where his army
was disembarked, together with three hundred epibatæ (or marines)
from the triremes,—including on this occasion, what was not commonly
the case on shipboard,<a id="FNanchor_486" href="#Footnote_486"
class="fnanchor">[486]</a> some of the choice hoplites, selected
all from young men of the same age, on the Athenian muster-roll.
Having passed the night in the sacred precinct of Zeus Nemeus at
Œneon, memorable as the spot where the poet Hesiod was said to have
been slain, he marched early in the morning, under the guidance of
the Messenian Chromon, into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[p.
299]</span> Ætolia; on the first day he took Potidania, on the second
Krokyleium, on the third Teichium,—all of them villages unfortified
and undefended, for the inhabitants abandoned them and fled to the
mountains above. He was here inclined to halt and wait the junction
of the Ozolian Lokrians, who had engaged to invade Ætolia at the
same time, and were almost indispensable to his success, from their
familiarity with Ætolian warfare and similarity of weapons. But the
Messenians again persuaded him to advance without delay into the
interior, in order that the villages might be separately attacked
and taken before any collective force could be gathered together:
and Demosthenês was so encouraged by having as yet encountered
no resistance, that he advanced to Ægitium, which he also found
deserted, and captured without opposition.</p>

<p>Here however was the term of his good fortune. The mountains
round Ægitium were occupied not only by the inhabitants of that
village, but also by the entire force of Ætolia, collected even
from the distant tribes Bomiês and Kalliês, who bordered on the
Maliac gulf. The invasion of Demosthenês had become known beforehand
to the Ætolians, who not only forewarned all their tribes of
the approaching enemy, but also sent ambassadors to Sparta and
Corinth to ask for aid.<a id="FNanchor_487" href="#Footnote_487"
class="fnanchor">[487]</a> However, they showed themselves fully
capable of defending their own territory, without foreign aid: and
Demosthenês found himself assailed, in his position at Ægitium, on
all sides at once, by these active highlanders, armed with javelins,
pouring down from the neighboring hills. Not engaging in any close
combat, they retreated when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[p.
300]</span> the Athenians advanced forward to charge them,—resuming
their aggression the moment that the pursuers, who could never
advance far in consequence of the ruggedness of the ground, began
to return to the main body. The small number of bowmen along with
Demosthenês for some time kept their unshielded assailants at bay;
but the officer commanding the bowmen was presently slain, and the
stock of arrows became nearly exhausted; and what was still worse,
Chromon, the Messenian, the only man who knew the country, and
could serve as guide, was slain also. The bowmen became thus either
ineffective or dispersed; while the hoplites exhausted themselves
in vain attempts to pursue and beat off an active enemy, who always
returned upon them, and in every successive onset thinned and
distressed them more and more. At length the force of Demosthenês
was completely broken, and compelled to take flight; but without
beaten roads, without guides, and in a country not only strange to
them, but impervious from continual mountain, rock, and forest. Many
of them were slain in the flight by pursuers, superior not less in
rapidity of movement than in knowledge of the country: some even
lost themselves in the forest, and perished miserably in flames
kindled around them by the Ætolians: and the fugitives were at
length reassembled at Œneon, near the sea, with the loss of Proklês,
the colleague of Demosthenês in command, as well as of one hundred
and twenty hoplites, among the best-armed and most vigorous in the
Athenian muster-roll.<a id="FNanchor_488" href="#Footnote_488"
class="fnanchor">[488]</a> The remaining force was soon transported
back from Naupaktus to Athens, but Demosthenês remained behind, being
too much afraid of the displeasure of his countrymen to return at
such a moment. It is certain that his conduct was such as justly to
incur their displeasure; and that the expedition against Ætolia,
alienating an established ally and provoking a new enemy, had been
conceived with a degree of rashness which nothing but the unexpected
favor of fortune could have counterbalanced.</p>

<p>The force of the new enemy whom his unsuccessful attack had
raised into activity, soon made itself felt. The Ætolian envoys
despatched to Sparta and Corinth found it easy to obtain the
promise of a considerable force to join them in an expedition<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[p. 301]</span> against Naupaktus: and
about the month of September, a body of three thousand Peloponnesian
hoplites, including five hundred from the newly-founded colony of
Herakleia, was assembled at Delphi, under the command of Eurylochus,
Makarius, and Menedemus. Their road of march to Naupaktus lay
through the territory of the Ozolian Lokrians, whom they proposed
either to gain over or to subdue. With Amphissa, the largest Lokrian
township, and in the immediate neighborhood of Delphi, they had
little difficulty,—for the Amphissians were in a state of feud with
their neighbors on the other side of Parnassus, and were afraid that
the new armament might become the instrument of Phocian antipathy
against them. On the very first application they joined the Spartan
alliance, and gave hostages for their fidelity to it: moreover, they
persuaded many other Lokrian petty villages—among others the Myoneis,
who were masters of the most difficult pass on the road—to do the
same. Eurylochus received from these various townships reinforcements
for his army, as well as hostages for their fidelity, whom he
deposited at Kytinium in Doris: and he was thus enabled to march
through all the territory of the Ozolian Lokrians without resistance;
except from Œneon and Eupalion, both which places he took by force.
Having arrived in the territory of Naupaktus, he was there joined
by the full force of the Ætolians; and their joint efforts, after
laying waste all the neighborhood, captured the Corinthian colony
of Molykreion, which had become subject to the Athenian empire.<a
id="FNanchor_489" href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a></p>

<p>Naupaktus, with a large circuit of wall and thinly defended, was
in the greatest danger, and would certainly have been taken, had
it not been saved by the efforts of the Athenian Demosthenês, who
had remained there ever since the unfortunate Ætolian expedition.
Apprized of the coming march of Eurylochus, he went personally to
the Akarnanians, and persuaded them to send a force to aid in the
defence of Naupaktus: for a long time they turned a deaf ear to his
solicitations, in consequence of the refusal to blockade Leukas, but
they were at length induced to consent. At the head of one thousand
Akarnanian hoplites, Demosthenês threw himself into Naupaktus; and
Eurylochus,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[p. 302]</span>
seeing that the town had thus been placed out of the reach of attack,
abandoned all his designs upon it,—marching farther westward to the
neighboring territories of Ætolia, Kalydon, Pleuron, and Proschium,
near the Achelôus and the borders of Akarnania. The Ætolians, who had
come down to join him for the common purpose of attacking Naupaktus,
here abandoned him and retired to their respective homes. But the
Ambrakiots, rejoiced to find so considerable a Peloponnesian force in
their neighborhood, prevailed upon him to assist them in attacking
the Amphilochian Argos as well as Akarnania; assuring him that there
was now a fair prospect of bringing the whole of the population of
the mainland, between the Ambrakian and Corinthian gulfs, under the
supremacy of Lacedæmon. Having persuaded Eurylochus thus to keep
his forces together and ready, they themselves with three thousand
Ambrakiot hoplites invaded the territory of the Amphilochian Argos,
and captured the fortified hill of Olpæ immediately bordering on
the Ambrakian gulf, about three miles from Argos itself: this hill
had been in former days employed by the Akarnanians as a place for
public judicial congress of the whole nation.<a id="FNanchor_490"
href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a></p>

<p>This enterprise, communicated forthwith to Eurylochus, was the
signal for movement on both sides. The Akarnanians marched with
their whole force to the protection of Argos, and occupied a post
called Krênæ in the Amphilochian territory, hoping to be able to
prevent Eurylochus from effecting his junction with the Ambrakiots
at Olpæ. They at the same time sent urgent messages to Demosthenês
at Naupaktus, and to the Athenian guard-squadron of twenty triremes
under Aristotelês and Hierophon, entreating their aid in the present
need, and inviting Demosthenês to act as their commander. They had
forgotten their displeasure against him arising out of his recent
refusal to blockade at Leukas,—for which they probably thought that
he had been sufficiently punished by his disgrace in Ætolia; while
they knew and esteemed his military capacity. In fact, the accident
whereby he had been detained at Naupaktus, now worked fortunately
for them as well as for him: it secured to them a commander whom all
of them respected, obviating the jealousies<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_303">[p. 303]</span> among their own numerous petty
townships,—it procured for him the means of retrieving his own
reputation at Athens. Demosthenês, not backward in seizing this
golden opportunity, came speedily into the Ambrakian gulf with the
twenty Athenian triremes, conducting two hundred Messenian hoplites
and sixty Athenian bowmen. He found the whole Akarnanian force
concentrated at the Amphilochian Argos, and was named general along
with the Akarnanian generals, but in reality enjoying the whole
direction of the operations.</p>

<p>He found also the whole of the enemy’s force, both the three
thousand Ambrakiot hoplites and the Peloponnesian division under
Eurylochus, already united and in position at Olpæ, about three miles
off. For Eurylochus, as soon as he was apprized that the Ambrakiots
had reached Olpæ, broke up forthwith his camp at Proschium in Ætolia,
knowing that his best chance of traversing the hostile territory of
Akarnania consisted in celerity: the whole Akarnanian force, however,
had already gone to Argos, so that his march was unopposed through
that country. He crossed the Achelôus, marched westward of Stratus,
through the Akarnanian townships of Phytia, Medeon, and Limnæa, then
quitting both Akarnania and the direct road from Akarnania to Argos,
he struck rather eastward into the mountainous district of Thyamus,
in the territory of the Agræans, who were enemies of the Akarnanians.
From hence he descended at night into the territory of Argos, and
passed unobserved under cover of the darkness between Argos itself,
and the Akarnanian force at Krênæ; so as to join in safety the three
thousand Ambrakiots at Olpæ; to their great joy,—for they had feared
that the enemy at Argos and Krênæ would have arrested his passage;
and feeling their force inadequate to contend alone, they had sent
pressing messages home to demand large reinforcements for themselves
and their own protection.<a id="FNanchor_491" href="#Footnote_491"
class="fnanchor">[491]</a></p>

<p>Demosthenês thus found an united and formidable enemy, superior
in number to himself, at Olpæ, and conducted his troops from Argos
and Krênæ to attack them. The ground was rugged and mountainous, and
between the two armies lay a steep ravine which neither liked to be
the first to pass, so that they lay for five<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_304">[p. 304]</span> days inactive. If Herodotus had
been our historian, he would probably have ascribed this delay to
unfavorable sacrifices (which may probably have been the case), and
would have given us interesting anecdotes respecting the prophets on
both sides; but the more positive and practical genius of Thucydidês
merely acquaints us, that on the sixth day both armies put themselves
in order of battle,—both probably tired of waiting. The ground being
favorable for ambuscade, Demosthenês hid in a bushy dell four hundred
hoplites and light-armed, so that they might spring up suddenly in
the midst of the action upon the Peloponnesian left, which outflanked
his right. He was himself on the right with the Messenians and
some Athenians, opposed to Eurylochus on the left of the enemy:
the Akarnanians, with the Amphilochian akontists, or darters,
occupied his left, opposed to the Ambrakiot hoplites: Ambrakiots and
Peloponnesians were, however, intermixed in the line of Eurylochus,
and it was only the Mantineans who maintained a separate station of
their own towards the left centre. The battle accordingly began,
and Eurylochus with his superior numbers was proceeding to surround
Demosthenês, when on a sudden the men in ambush rose up and set
upon his rear. A panic seized his men, and they made no resistance
worthy of their Peloponnesian reputation: they broke and fled, while
Eurylochus, doubtless exposing himself with peculiar bravery in
order to restore the battle, was early slain. Demosthenês, having
near him his best troops, pressed them vigorously and their panic
communicated itself to the troops in the centre, so that all were
put to flight and pursued to Olpæ. On the right of the line of
Eurylochus, the Ambrakiots, the most warlike Greeks in the Epirotic
regions, completely defeated the Akarnanians opposed to them, and
carried their pursuit even as far as Argos. So complete, however, was
the victory gained by Demosthenês over the remaining troops, that
these Ambrakiots had great difficulty in fighting their way back to
Olpæ, which was not accomplished without severe loss, and late in
the evening. Among all the beaten troops, the Mantineans were those
who best maintained their retreating order.<a id="FNanchor_492"
href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a> The loss in the army
of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[p. 305]</span> Demosthenês
was about three hundred: that of the opponents much greater, but the
number is not specified.</p>

<p>Of the three Spartan commanders, two, Eurylochus and Makarius, had
been slain: the third, Menedæus, found himself beleaguered both by
sea and land,—the Athenian squadron being on guard along the coast.
It would seem, indeed, that he might have fought his way to Ambrakia,
especially as he would have met the Ambrakiot reinforcement coming
from the city. But whether this were possible or not, the commander,
too much dispirited to attempt it, took advantage of the customary
truce granted for burying the dead, to open negotiations with
Demosthenês and the Akarnanian generals, for the purpose of obtaining
an unmolested retreat. This was peremptorily refused: but Demosthenês
(with the consent of the Akarnanian leaders) secretly intimated to
the Spartan commander and those immediately around him, together
with the Mantineans and other Peloponnesian troops,—that if they
chose to make a separate and surreptitious retreat, abandoning their
comrades, no opposition would be offered: for he designed by this
means, not merely to isolate the Ambrakiots, the great enemies of
Argos and Akarnania, along with the body of miscellaneous mercenaries
who had come under Eurylochus, but also to obtain the more permanent
advantage of disgracing the Spartans and Peloponnesians in the
eyes of the Epirotic Greeks, as cowards and traitors to military
fellowship. The very reason which prompted Demosthenês to grant a
separate facility of escape, ought to have been imperative with
Menedæus and the Peloponnesians around him, to make them spurn it
with indignation: yet such was their anxiety for personal safety,
that this disgraceful convention was accepted, ratified, and carried
into effect forthwith. It stands alone in Grecian history, as a
specimen of separate treason in officers, to purchase safety for
themselves by abandoning those under their command. Had the officers
been Athenian, it would have been doubtless quoted as an example of
the pretended faithlessness of democracy: but as it was the act of a
Spartan commander in conjunction with many leading Peloponnesians,
we can only remark upon it as a farther manifestation of that
intra-Peloponnesian selfishness, and carelessness of obligation<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[p. 306]</span> towards
extra-Peloponnesian Greeks, which we found so lamentably prevalent
during the invasion of Xerxes; in this case indeed heightened by the
fact that the men deserted were fellow-Dorians and fellow-soldiers,
who had just fought in the same ranks.</p>

<p>As soon as the ceremony of burying the dead had been completed,
Menedæus, and the Peloponnesians who were protected by this secret
convention, stole away slyly and in small bands under pretence of
collecting wood and vegetables: on getting to a little distance,
they quickened their pace and made off,—much to the dismay of the
Ambrakiots, who ran after them and tried to overtake them. The
Akarnanians pursued, and their leaders had much difficulty in
explaining to them the secret convention just concluded. Nor was
it without some suspicions of treachery, and even personal hazard,
from their own troops, that they at length caused the fugitive
Peloponnesians to be respected; while the Ambrakiots, the most
obnoxious of the two to Akarnanian feeling, were pursued without any
reserve, and two hundred of them were slain before they could escape
into the friendly territory of the Agræans.<a id="FNanchor_493"
href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a> To distinguish
Ambrakiots from Peloponnesians, similar in race and dialect, was,
however, no easy task, and much dispute arose in individual cases.</p>

<p>Unfairly as this loss fell upon Ambrakia, a far more severe
calamity was yet in store for her. The large reinforcement from the
city, which had been urgently invoked by the detachment at Olpæ,
started in due course as soon as it could be got ready, and entered
the territory of Amphilochia about the time when the battle of Olpæ
was fought, but ignorant of that misfortune, and hoping to arrive
soon enough to stand by their friends. Their march was made known to
Demosthenês, on the day after the battle, by the Amphilochians; who,
at the same time, indicated to him the best way of surprising them
in the rugged and mountainous road along which they had to march,
at the two conspicuous peaks called Idomenê, immediately above a
narrow pass leading farther on to Olpæ. It was known beforehand, by
the line of march of the Ambrakiots, that they would rest for the
night at the lower of these two peaks, ready to march through<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[p. 307]</span> the pass on the next
morning. On that same night, a detachment of Amphilochians, under
direction from Demosthenês, seized the higher of the two peaks; while
that commander himself, dividing his forces into two divisions,
started from his position at Olpæ in the evening after supper. One of
these divisions, having the advantage of Amphilochian guides in their
own country, marched by an unfrequented mountain road to Idomenê;
the other, under Demosthenês himself, went directly through the pass
leading from Idomenê to Olpæ. After marching all night, they reached
the camp of the Ambrakiots a little before daybreak,—Demosthenês
himself with his Messenians in the van. The surprise was complete;
the Ambrakiots were found still lying down and asleep, while even
the sentinels, uninformed of the recent battle,—hearing themselves
accosted in the Doric dialect by the Messenians, whom Demosthenês
had placed in front for that express purpose, and not seeing very
clearly in the morning twilight, mistook them for some of their own
fellow-citizens coming back from the other camp. The Akarnanians
and Messenians thus fell among the Ambrakiots sleeping and unarmed,
and without any possibility of resistance. Large numbers of them
were destroyed on the spot, and the remainder fled in all directions
among the neighboring mountains, none knowing the roads and the
country; it was the country of the Amphilochians, subjects of
Ambrakia, but subjects averse to their condition, and now making
use of their perfect local knowledge and light-armed equipment, to
inflict a terrible revenge on their masters. Some of the Ambrakiots
became entangled in ravines,—others fell into ambuscades laid by the
Amphilochians. Others again, dreading most of all to fall into the
hands of the Amphilochians, barbaric in race as well as intensely
hostile in feeling, and seeing no other possibility of escaping them,
swam off to the Athenian ships cruising along the shore. There were
but a small proportion of them who survived to return to Ambrakia.<a
id="FNanchor_494" href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a></p>

<p>The complete victory of Idomenê, admirably prepared by
Demosthenês, was achieved with scarce any loss: and the Akarnanians,
after erecting their trophy, despoiled the enemy’s dead and carried
off the arms thus taken to Argos.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[p. 308]</span></p>

<p>On the morrow they were visited by a herald, coming from those
Ambrakiots who had fled into the Agræan territory, after the battle
of Olpæ, and the subsequent pursuit. He came with the customary
request from defeated soldiers, for permission to bury their dead who
had fallen in that pursuit. Neither he, nor those from whom he came,
knew anything of the destruction of their brethren at Idomenê,—just
as these latter had been ignorant of the defeat at Olpæ; while,
on the other hand, the Akarnanians in the camp, whose minds were
full of the more recent and capital advantage at Idomenê, supposed
that the message referred to the men slain in that engagement. The
numerous panoplies just acquired at Idomenê lay piled up in the
camp, and the herald, on seeing them, was struck with amazement at
the size of the heap, so much exceeding the number of those who were
missing in his own detachment. An Akarnanian present asked the reason
of his surprise, and inquired how many of his comrades had been
slain,—meaning to refer to the slain at Idomenê. “About two hundred,”
the herald replied. “Yet these arms here show, not that number, but
more than a thousand men.” “Then they are not the arms of those who
fought with us.” “Nay, but they are; if ye were the persons who
fought yesterday at Idomenê.” “We fought with no one yesterday: it
was the day before yesterday, in the retreat.” “O, then ye have to
learn, that <i>we</i> were engaged yesterday with these others, who were
on their march as reinforcement from the city of Ambrakia.”</p>

<p>The unfortunate herald now learned for the first time that
the large reinforcement from his city had been cut to pieces.
So acute was his feeling of mingled anguish and surprise, that
he raised a loud cry of woe, and hurried away at once, without
saying another word; not even prosecuting his request about the
burial of the dead bodies,—which appears on this fatal occasion
to have been neglected.<a id="FNanchor_495" href="#Footnote_495"
class="fnanchor">[495]</a></p>

<p>His grief was justified by the prodigious magnitude of the
calamity, which Thucydidês considers to have been the greatest that
afflicted any Grecian city during the whole war prior to the peace
of Nikias; so incredibly great, indeed, that though he had<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[p. 309]</span> learned the number
slain, he declines to set it down, from fear of not being believed,—a
scruple which we, his readers, have much reason to regret. It
appears that nearly the whole adult military population of Ambrakia
was destroyed, and Demosthenês was urgent with the Akarnanians to
march thither at once: had they consented, Thucydidês tells us
positively that the city would have surrendered without a blow.<a
id="FNanchor_496" href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a> But
they refused to undertake the enterprise, fearing, according to the
historian, that the Athenians at Ambrakia would be more troublesome
neighbors to them than the Ambrakiots. That this reason was
operative, we need not doubt: but it can hardly have been either the
single, or even the chief, reason; for, had it been so, they would
have been equally afraid of Athenian coöperation in the blockade
of Leukas, which they had strenuously solicited from Demosthenês,
and had quarrelled with him for refusing. Ambrakia was less near
to them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[p. 310]</span> than
Leukas, and in its present exhausted state, inspired less fear: but
the displeasure arising from the former refusal of Demosthenês had
probably never been altogether appeased, nor were they sorry to find
an opportunity of mortifying him in a similar manner.</p>

<p>In the distribution of the spoil, three hundred panoplies were
first set apart as the perquisite of Demosthenês: the remainder
were then distributed, one-third for the Athenians, the other
two-thirds among the Akarnanian townships. The immense reserve,
personally appropriated to Demosthenês, enables us to make some
vague conjecture as to the total loss of Ambrakiots. The fraction of
one-third, assigned to the Athenian people, must have been, we may
imagine, six times as great, and perhaps even in larger proportion,
than the reserve of the general: for the latter was at that time
under the displeasure of the people, and anxious above all things
to regain their favor,—an object which would be frustrated rather
than promoted, if his personal share of the arms were not greatly
disproportionate to the collective claim of the city. Reasoning upon
this supposition, the panoplies assigned to Athens would be eighteen
hundred, and the total of Ambrakiot slain, whose arms became public
property, would be five thousand four hundred. To which must be
added some Ambrakiots killed in their flight from Idomenê by the
Amphilochians, in dells, ravines, and by-places: probably those
Amphilochians, who slew them, would appropriate the arms privately,
without bringing them into the general stock. Upon this calculation,
the total number of Ambrakiot slain in both battles and both
pursuits, would be about six thousand: a number suitable to the grave
expressions of Thucydidês, as well as to his statements, that the
first detachment which marched to Olpæ was three thousand strong, and
that the message sent home invoked as reinforcement the total force
of the city. How totally helpless Ambrakia had become, is still more
conclusively proved by the fact that the Corinthians were obliged
shortly afterwards to send by land a detachment of three hundred
hoplites for its defence.<a id="FNanchor_497" href="#Footnote_497"
class="fnanchor">[497]</a></p>

<p>The Athenian triremes soon returned to their station at Nau<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[p. 311]</span>paktus, after which a
convention was concluded between the Akarnanians and Amphilochians
on the one side, and the Ambrakiots and Peloponnesians—who had
fled after the battle of Olpæ into the territory of Salynthius
and the Agræi—on the other, insuring a safe and unmolested egress
to both of the latter.<a id="FNanchor_498" href="#Footnote_498"
class="fnanchor">[498]</a> With the Ambrakiots a more permanent
pacification was effected: the Akarnanians and Amphilochians
concluded with them a peace and alliance for one hundred years, on
condition that they should surrender all the Amphilochian territory
and hostages in their possession, and should bind themselves to
furnish no aid to Anaktorium, then in hostility to the Akarnanians.
Each party, however, maintained its separate alliance,—the Ambrakiots
with the Peloponnesian confederacy, the Akarnanians with Athens: it
was stipulated that the Akarnanians should<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_312">[p. 312]</span> not be required to assist the
Ambrakiots against Athens, nor the Ambrakiots to assist the
Akarnanians against the Peloponnesian league; but against all other
enemies, each engaged to lend aid to the other.<a id="FNanchor_499"
href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a></p>

<p>To Demosthenês personally, the events on the coast of the
Ambrakian gulf proved a signal good fortune, well-earned indeed by
the skill which he had displayed. He was enabled to atone for his
imprudence in the Ætolian expedition, and to reëstablish himself
in the favor of the Athenian people. He sailed home in triumph to
Athens, during the course of the winter, with his reserved present
of three hundred panoplies, which acquired additional value from
the accident, that the larger number of panoplies, reserved out of
the spoil for the Athenian people, were captured at sea, and never
reached Athens. Accordingly, those brought by Demosthenês were
the only trophy of the victory, and as such were deposited in the
Athenian temples, where Thucydidês mentions them as still existing
at the time when he wrote.<a id="FNanchor_500" href="#Footnote_500"
class="fnanchor">[500]</a></p>

<p>It was in the same autumn that the Athenians were induced by an
oracle to undertake the more complete purification of the sacred
island of Delos. This step was probably taken to propitiate Apollo,
since they were under the persuasion that the terrible visitation
of the epidemic was owing to his wrath. And as it was about this
period that the second attack of the epidemic, after having lasted a
year, disappeared,—many of them probably ascribed this relief to the
effect of their pious cares at Delos. All the tombs in the island
were opened; the dead bodies were then exhumed, and reinterred in
the neighboring island of Rheneia: and orders were given that for
the future no deaths and no births should take place in the sacred
island. Moreover, the ancient Delian festival—once the common point
of meeting and solemnity for the whole Ionic race, and celebrated
for its musical contests, before the Lydian and Persian conquests
had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[p. 313]</span> subverted
the freedom and prosperity of Ionia—was now renewed. The Athenians
celebrated the festival with its accompanying matches, even the
chariot-race, in a manner more splendid than had ever been known in
former times: and they appointed a similar festival to be celebrated
every fourth year. At this period they were excluded both from the
Olympic and the Pythian games, which probably made the revival of
the Delian festival more gratifying to them. The religious zeal
and munificence of Nikias was strikingly displayed at Delos.<a

  <h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER LII.<br />
    SEVENTH YEAR OF THE WAR.—CAPTURE OF SPHAKTERIA.</h2>
</div>

<p class="ti0"><span class="smcap">The</span> invasion of Attica by
the Lacedæmonians had now become an ordinary enterprise, undertaken
in every year of the war except the third and sixth, and then omitted
only from accidental causes; though the same hopes were no longer
entertained from it as at the commencement of the war. During the
present spring, Agis king of Sparta conducted the Peloponnesian army
into the territory, seemingly about the end of April, and repeated
the usual ravages.</p>

<p>It seemed, however, as if Korkyra were about to become the
principal scene of the year’s military operations: for the exiles
of the oligarchical party, having come back to the island and
fortified themselves on Mount Istônê, carried on war with so much
activity against the Korkyræans in the city, that distress and even
famine reigned there; while sixty Peloponnesian triremes were sent
thither to assist the aggressors. As soon as it became known at
Athens how hardly the Korkyræans in the city were pressed, orders
were given to an Athenian fleet of forty triremes, about to sail for
Sicily under Eurymedon and Sophoklês, to halt<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_314">[p. 314]</span> in their voyage at Korkyra, and
to lend whatever aid might be needed.<a id="FNanchor_502"
href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a> But during the
course of this voyage, an incident occurred elsewhere, neither
foreseen nor imagined by any one, which gave a new character and
promise to the whole war,—illustrating forcibly the observations of
Periklês and Archidamus before its commencement, on the impossibility
of calculating what turn events might take.<a id="FNanchor_503"
href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a></p>

<p>So high did Demosthenês stand in the favor of his countrymen,
after his brilliant successes in the Ambrakian gulf, that they
granted him permission, at his own request, to go aboard and to
employ the fleet in any descent which he might think expedient on the
coast of Peloponnesus. The attachment of this active officer to the
Messenians at Naupaktus, inspired him with the idea of planting a
detachment of them on some well-chosen maritime post in the ancient
Messenian territory, from whence they would be able permanently to
harass the Lacedæmonians and provoke revolt among the Helots,—the
more so, from their analogy of race and dialect. The Messenians,
active in privateering, and doubtless well acquainted with the points
of this coast, all of which had formerly belonged to their ancestors,
had probably indicated to him Pylus, on the southwestern shore. That
ancient and Homeric name was applied specially and properly to denote
the promontory which forms the northern termination of the modern
bay of Navarino, opposite to the island of Sphagia, or Sphakteria;
though in vague language the whole neighboring district seems
also to have been called Pylus. Accordingly, in circumnavigating
Laconia, Demosthenês requested that the fleet might be detained at
this spot long enough to enable him to fortify it, engaging himself
to stay afterwards and maintain it with a garrison. It was an
uninhabited promontory, about forty-five miles from Sparta; that is,
as far distant as any portion of her territory, presenting rugged
cliffs, and easy of defence both by sea and land: but its great
additional recommendation, with reference to the maritime power
of Athens, consisted in its overhanging the spacious and secure
basin now called the bay of Navarino. That basin was fronted and
protected by the islet called Sphakteria, or Sphagia, untrod<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[p. 315]</span>den, untenanted, and
full of wood, which stretched along the coast for about a mile
and three quarters, leaving only two narrow entrances: one at its
northern end, opposite to the position fixed on by Demosthenês,
so confined as to admit only two triremes abreast,—the other at
the southern end, about four times as broad; while the inner water
approached by these two channels was both roomy and protected. It
was on the coast of Peloponnesus, a little within the northern or
narrowest of the two channels, that Demosthenês proposed to plant
his little fort,—the ground being itself eminently favorable, and
a spring of fresh water<a id="FNanchor_504" href="#Footnote_504"
class="fnanchor">[504]</a> in the centre of the promontory.<a
id="FNanchor_505" href="#Footnote_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[p. 316]</span></p>

<p>But Eurymedon and Sophoklês decidedly rejected all proposition of
delay; and with much reason, since they had been informed (though
seemingly without truth) that the Peloponnesian fleet had actually
reached Korkyra: they might well have remembered the mischief which
had ensued three years before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[p.
317]</span> from the delay of the reinforcement sent to Phormio
in some desultory operations on the coast of Krete. The fleet
accordingly passed by Pylus without stopping: but a terrible
storm drove them back and forced them to seek shelter in the very
harbor which Demosthenês had fixed upon,—the only harbor anywhere
near. That officer took advantage of this accident to renew his
proposition, which however appeared to the commanders chimerical:
there were plenty of desert capes round Peloponnesus, they said, if
he chose to waste the resources of the city in occupying them,<a
id="FNanchor_506" href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a>—nor
were they at all moved by his reasons in reply. Finding himself thus
unsuccessful, Demosthenês presumed upon the undefined permission
granted to him by the Athenian people, to address himself first to
the soldiers, last of all to the taxiarchs, or inferior officers,
and to persuade them to second his project, even against the will
of the commanders. Much inconvenience might well have arisen
from such clashing of authority: but it happened that both the
soldiers and the taxiarchs took the same view of the case as their
commanders, and refused compliance: nor can we be surprised at
such reluctance, when we reflect upon the seeming improbability
of being able to maintain such a post against the great real, and
still greater supposed, superiority of Lacedæmonian land-force.
It happened, however, that the fleet was detained there for some
days by stormy weather; so that the soldiers, having nothing to do,
were seized with the spontaneous impulse of occupying themselves
with the fortification, and crowded around to execute it with all
the emulation of eager volunteers. Having contemplated nothing
of the kind on starting from Athens, they had neither tools for
cutting stone, nor hods for carrying mortar:<a id="FNanchor_507"
href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a> accordingly, they
were compelled to build their wall by collecting such pieces of rock
or stones as they found, and putting them together as each happened
to fit in: whenever mortar was needed, they brought it up on their
backs bent inwards, with hands joined behind them to prevent it from
slipping away. Such deficiencies were made up, however, partly by the
unbounded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[p. 318]</span> ardor
of the soldiers, partly by the natural difficulties of the ground,
which hardly required fortification except at particular points; the
work was completed in a rough way in six days, and Demosthenês was
left in garrison with five ships, while Eurymedon with the main fleet
sailed away to Korkyra. The crews of the five ships, two of which,
however, were sent away to warn Eurymedon afterwards, would amount
to about one thousand in all: but there presently arrived two armed
Messenian privateers, from which Demosthenês obtained a reinforcement
of forty Messenian hoplites, together with a supply of wicker
shields, though more fit for show than for use, wherewith to arm
his rowers. Altogether, it appears that he must have had about two
hundred hoplites, besides the half-armed seamen.<a id="FNanchor_508"
href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a></p>

<p>Intelligence of this attempt to plant, even upon the Lacedæmonian
territory, the annoyance and insult of a hostile post, was soon
transmitted to Sparta,—yet no immediate measures were taken to
march to the spot; as well from the natural slowness of the Spartan
character, strengthened by a festival which happened to be then going
on, as from the confidence entertained that, whenever attacked, the
expulsion of the enemy was certain. A stronger impression, however,
was made by the news upon the Lacedæmonian army invading Attica, who
were at the same time suffering from want of provisions, the corn
not being yet ripe, and from an unusually cold spring: accordingly,
Agis marched them back to Sparta, and the fortification of Pylus thus
produced the effect of abridging the invasion to the unusually short
period of fifteen days. It operated in like manner to the protection
of Korkyra: for the Peloponnesian fleet, recently arrived thither,
or still on its way, received orders immediately to return for the
attack of Pylus. Having avoided the Athenian fleet by transporting
the ships across the isthmus at Leukas, it reached Pylus about the
same time as the Lacedæmonian land-force from Sparta, composed
of the Spartans themselves and the neighboring Periœki: for the
more distant Periœki, as well as the Pelopon<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_319">[p. 319]</span>nesian allies, being just returned from
Attica, were summoned to come as soon as they could, but did not
accompany this first march.<a id="FNanchor_509" href="#Footnote_509"
class="fnanchor">[509]</a></p>

<p>At the last moment, before the Peloponnesian fleet came in and
occupied the harbor, Demosthenês detached two out of his five
triremes to warn Eurymedon and the main fleet, and to entreat
immediate succor: the remaining ships he hauled ashore under the
fortification, protecting them by palisades planted in front, and
preparing to defend himself in the best manner he could. Having
posted the larger portion of his force,—some of them mere seamen
without arms, and many only half-armed,—round the assailable points
of the fortification, to resist attacks from the land-force, he
himself, with sixty chosen hoplites and a few bowmen, marched out of
the fortification down to the sea-shore. It was on that side that
the wall was weakest, for the Athenians, confident in their naval
superiority, had given themselves little trouble to provide against
an assailant fleet. Accordingly, Demosthenês foresaw that the great
stress of the attack would lie on the sea-side, and his only chance
of safety consisted in preventing the enemy from landing; a purpose,
seconded by the rocky and perilous shore, which left no possibility
of approach for ships, except on a narrow space immediately under
the fortification. It was here that he took post, on the water’s
edge, addressing a few words of encouragement to his men, and
warning them that it was useless now to display acuteness in summing
up perils which were but too obvious,—and that the only chance of
escape lay in boldly encountering the enemy before they could set
foot ashore; the difficulty of effecting a landing from ships in
the face of resistance being better known to Athenian mariners
than to any one else.<a id="FNanchor_510" href="#Footnote_510"
class="fnanchor">[510]</a></p>

<p>With a fleet of forty-three triremes, under Thrasymelidas, and
a powerful land-force, simultaneously attacking, the Lacedæmonians
had good hopes of storming at once a rock so hastily converted
into a military post. But as they foresaw that the first attack
might possibly fail, and that the fleet of Eurymedon would probably
return, they resolved to occupy forthwith the island of Sphakteria,
the natural place where the Athenian fleet would take station for
the purpose of assisting the garrison ashore.<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_320">[p. 320]</span> The neighboring coast on the mainland
of Peloponnesus was both harborless and hostile, so that there was no
other spot near, where they could take station. And the Lacedæmonian
commanders reckoned upon being able to stop up, as it were
mechanically, both the two entrances into the harbor, by triremes
lashed together, from the island to the mainland, with their prows
pointing outwards; so that they would be able at any rate, occupying
the island as well as the two channels, to keep off the Athenian
fleet, and to hold Demosthenês closely blocked up<a id="FNanchor_511"
href="#Footnote_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a> on the rock of Pylus,
where his provisions would quickly fail him. With these views, they
drafted off by lot some hoplites from each of the Spartan lochi,
accompanied as usual by Helots, and sent them across to Sphakteria;
while their land-force and their fleet approached at once to attack
the fortification.</p>

<p>Of the assault on the land-side, we hear little: the Lacedæmonians
were proverbially unskilful in the attack of anything like a
fortified place, and they appear now to have made little impression.
But the chief stress and vigor of the attack came on the sea-side, as
Demosthenês had foreseen. The landing-place, even where practicable,
was still rocky and difficult,—and so narrow in dimensions, that
the Lacedæmonian ships could only approach by small squadrons at a
time; while the Athenians maintained their ground firmly to prevent
a single man from setting foot on land. The assailing triremes rowed
up with loud shouts and exhortations to each other, striving to get
so placed as that the hoplites in the bow could effect a landing:
but such were the difficulties arising partly from the rocks and
partly from the defence, that squadron after squadron tried this
in vain. Nor did even the gallant example of Brasidas procure for
them any better success. That officer, commanding a trireme, and
observing that some of the pilots near him were cautious in driving
their ships close in shore for fear of breaking them against the
rocks, indignantly called to them not to spare the planks of their
vessels, when the enemy had insulted them by erecting a fort in the
country: Lacedæmonians, he exclaimed, ought to carry the landing by
force, even though their ships should be dashed<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_321">[p. 321]</span> to pieces,—nor ought the Peloponnesian
allies to be backward in sacrificing their ships for Sparta, in
return for the many services which she had rendered to them.<a
id="FNanchor_512" href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a>
Foremost in performance as well as in exhortation, Brasidas
constrained his own pilot to drive his ship close in, and advanced in
person even on to the landing-steps for the purpose of leaping first
ashore. But here he stood exposed to all the weapons of the Athenian
defenders, who beat him back and pierced him with so many wounds,
that he fainted away, and fell back into the bows, or foremost part
of the trireme, beyond the rowers; while his shield, slipping away
from the arm, dropped down and rolled overboard into the sea. His
ship was obliged to retire, like the rest, without having effected
any landing: and all these successive attacks from the sea, repeated
for one whole day and a part of the next were repulsed by Demosthenês
and his little band with victorious bravery. To both sides it seemed
a strange reversal of ordinary relations,<a id="FNanchor_513"
href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a> that the Athenians,
essentially maritime, should be fighting on land—and that, too,
Lacedæmonian land—against the Lacedæmonians, the select land-warriors
of Greece, now on shipboard, and striving in vain to compass a
landing on their own shore. The Athenians, in honor of their success,
erected a trophy, the chief ornament of which was the shield of
Brasidas, which had been cast ashore by the water.</p>

<p>On the third day, the Lacedæmonians did not repeat their attack,
but sent some of their vessels round to Asinê, in the Messenian
gulf, for timber to construct battering machines; which they
intended to employ against the wall of Demosthenês, on the side
towards the harbor, where it was higher, and could not be assailed
without machines, but where, at the same time, there was great
facility in landing,—for their previous attack had been made on
the side fronting the sea, where the wall was lower, but<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[p. 322]</span> the difficulties
of landing insuperable.<a id="FNanchor_514" href="#Footnote_514"
class="fnanchor">[514]</a> But before these ships came back, the
face of affairs was seriously changed by the unwelcome return of
the Athenian fleet from Zakynthus, under Eurymedon, reinforced by
four Chian ships, and some of the guard-ships at Naupaktus, so
as now to muster fifty sail. The Athenian admiral, finding the
enemy’s fleet in possession of the harbor, and seeing both the
island of Sphakteria occupied, and the opposite shore covered with
Lacedæmonian hoplites,<a id="FNanchor_515" href="#Footnote_515"
class="fnanchor">[515]</a>—for the allies from all parts of
Peloponnesus had now arrived,—looked around in vain for a place to
land, and could find no other night-station except the uninhabited
island of Prôtê, not very far distant. From hence he sailed forth in
the morning to Pylus, prepared for a naval engagement,—hoping that
perhaps the Lacedæmonians might come out to fight him in the open
sea, but resolved, if this did not happen, to force his way in and
attack the fleet in the harbor; the breadth of sea between Sphakteria
and the mainland being sufficient to admit of nautical manœuvre.<a
id="FNanchor_516" href="#Footnote_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a>
The Lacedæmonian admirals, seemingly confounded by the speed of
the Athenian fleet in coming back, never thought of sailing out
of the harbor to fight, nor did they even realize their scheme of
blocking up the two entrances of the harbor with triremes<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[p. 323]</span> closely lashed
together. Both entrances were left open, though they determined to
defend themselves within: but even here, so defective were their
precautions, that several of their triremes were yet moored, and
the rowers not fully aboard, when the Athenian admirals sailed in
by both entrances at once to attack them. Most of the Lacedæmonian
triremes, afloat, and in fighting trim, resisted the attack for a
certain time, but were at length vanquished, and driven back to
the shore, many of them with serious injury.<a id="FNanchor_517"
href="#Footnote_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a> Five of them were
captured and towed off, one with all her crew aboard, and the
Athenians, vigorously pursuing their success, drove against such as
took refuge on the shore, as well as those which were not manned
at the moment when the attack began, and had not been able to get
afloat or into action. Some of the vanquished triremes being deserted
by their crews, who jumped out upon the land, the Athenians were
proceeding to tow them off, when the Lacedæmonian hoplites on the
shore opposed a new and strenuous resistance. Excited to the utmost
pitch by witnessing the disgraceful defeat of their fleet, and aware
of the cruel consequences which turned upon it,—they marched all
armed into the water, seized the ships to prevent them from being
dragged off, and engaged in a desperate conflict to baffle the
assailants: we have already seen a similar act of bravery, two years
before, on the part of the Messenian hoplites accompanying the fleet
of Phormio near Naupaktus.<a id="FNanchor_518" href="#Footnote_518"
class="fnanchor">[518]</a> Extraordinary daring and valor was here
displayed on both sides, in the attack as well as in the defence,
and such was the clamor and confusion, that neither the land skill
of the Lacedæmonians, nor the sea skill of the Athenians, were of
much avail: the contest was one of personal valor and considerable
suffering on both sides. At length the Lacedæmonians carried
their point, and saved all the ships ashore; none being carried
away except those at first captured. Both parties thus separated:
the Athenians retired to the fortress at Pylus, where they were
doubtless hailed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[p. 324]</span>
with overflowing joy by their comrades, and where they erected a
trophy for their victory, giving up the enemy’s dead for burial,
and picking up the floating wrecks and pieces.<a id="FNanchor_519"
href="#Footnote_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a></p>

<p>But the great prize of the victory was neither in the five ships
captured, nor in the relief afforded to the besieged at Pylus. It
lay in the hoplites occupying the island of Sphakteria, who were
now cut off from the mainland, as well as from all supplies. The
Athenians, sailing round it in triumph, already looked upon them as
their prisoners; while the Lacedæmonians on the opposite mainland,
deeply distressed, but not knowing what to do, sent to Sparta for
advice. So grave was the emergency, that the ephors came in person
to the spot forthwith. Since they could still muster sixty triremes,
a greater number than the Athenians,—besides a large force on land,
and the whole command of the resources of the country,—while the
Athenians had no footing on shore except the contracted promontory of
Pylus, we might have imagined that a strenuous effort to carry off
the imprisoned detachment across the narrow strait to the mainland
would have had a fair chance of success. And probably, if either
Demosthenês or Brasidas had been in command, such an effort would
have been made. But Lacedæmonian courage was rather steadfast and
unyielding than adventurous: and, moreover, the Athenian superiority
at sea exercised a sort of fascination over men’s minds, analogous
to that of the Spartans themselves on land; so that the ephors, on
reaching Pylus, took a desponding view of their position, and sent a
herald to the Athenian generals to propose an armistice, in order to
allow time for envoys to go to Athens and treat for peace.</p>

<p>To this Eurymedon and Demosthenês assented, and an armistice
was concluded on the following terms: The Lacedæmonians agreed to
surrender not only all their triremes now in the harbor, but also all
the rest in their ports, altogether to the number of sixty; also,
to abstain from all attack upon the fortress at Pylus, either by
land or sea, for such time as should be necessary for the mission of
envoys to Athens as well as for their return, both to be effected in
an Athenian trireme provided for the purpose. The Athenians on their
side engaged to desist from all hostilities<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_325">[p. 325]</span> during the like interval; but it was
agreed that they should keep strict and unremitting watch over
the island, yet without landing upon it. For the subsistence of
the detachment in the island, the Lacedæmonians were permitted to
send over every day two chœnikes of barley-meal in cakes, ready
baked, two kotylæ of wine,<a id="FNanchor_520" href="#Footnote_520"
class="fnanchor">[520]</a> and some meat, for each hoplite,—together
with half that quantity for each of the attendant Helots; but this
was all to be done under the supervision of the Athenians, with
peremptory obligation to send no secret additional supplies. It
was, moreover, expressly stipulated that if any one provision of
the armistice, small or great, were violated, the whole should be
considered as null and void. Lastly, the Athenians engaged, on the
return of the envoys from Athens, to restore the triremes in the same
condition as they received them.</p>

<p>Such terms sufficiently attest the humiliation and anxiety
of the Lacedæmonians; while the surrender of their entire naval
force to the number of sixty triremes, which was forthwith carried
into effect, demonstrates at the same time that they sincerely
believed in the possibility of obtaining peace. Well aware that
they were themselves the original beginners of the war, at a time
when the Athenians desired peace, and that the latter had besides
made fruitless overtures while under the pressure of the epidemic,
they presumed that the same dispositions still prevailed at
Athens, and that their present pacific wishes would be so gladly
welcomed as to procure without difficulty the relinquishment of the
prisoners in Sphakteria.<a id="FNanchor_521" href="#Footnote_521"
class="fnanchor">[521]</a></p>

<p>The Lacedæmonian envoys, conveyed to Athens in an Athenian
trireme, appeared before the public assembly to set forth their
mission, according to custom, prefacing their address with<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[p. 326]</span> some apologies for
that brevity of speech which belonged to their country. Their
proposition was in substance a very simple one: “Give up to us the
men in the island, and accept, in exchange for this favor, peace,
with the alliance of Sparta.” They enforced their cause, by appeals,
well-turned and conciliatory, partly indeed to the generosity, but
still more to the prudential calculation of Athens; explicitly
admitting the high and glorious vantage-ground on which she was now
placed, as well as their own humbled dignity and inferior position.<a
id="FNanchor_522" href="#Footnote_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a>
They, the Lacedæmonians, the first and greatest power in Greece,
were now smitten by adverse fortune of war,—and that too without
misconduct of their own, so that they were for the first time
obliged to solicit an enemy for peace; which Athens had the precious
opportunity of granting, not merely with honor to herself, but
also in such manner as to create in their minds an ineffaceable
friendship. And it became Athens to make use of her present good
fortune while she had it,—not to rely upon its permanence, nor to
abuse it by extravagant demands; her own imperial prudence, as well
as the present circumstances of the Spartans, might teach her how
unexpectedly the most disastrous casualties occurred. By granting
what was now asked, she might make a peace which would be far
more durable than if it were founded on the extorted compliances
of a weakened enemy, because it would rest on Spartan honor and
gratitude; the greater the previous enmity, the stronger would be
such reactionary sentiment.<a id="FNanchor_523" href="#Footnote_523"
class="fnanchor">[523]</a> But if Athens should now refuse, and if,
in the farther prosecution of the war, the men in Sphakteria should
perish,—a new and inexpiable ground of quarrel,<a id="FNanchor_524"
href="#Footnote_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a> peculiar to Sparta
herself, would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[p. 327]</span>
be added to those already subsisting, which rather concerned Sparta
as the chief of the Peloponnesian confederacy. Nor was it only the
good-will and gratitude of the Spartans which Athens would earn
by accepting the proposition tendered to her; she would farther
acquire the grace and glory of conferring peace on Greece, which
all the Greeks would recognize as her act. And when once the two
preëminent powers, Athens and Sparta, were established in cordial
amity, the remaining Grecian states would be too weak to resist what
they two might prescribe.<a id="FNanchor_525" href="#Footnote_525"
class="fnanchor">[525]</a></p>

<p>Such was the language held by the Lacedæmonians in the assembly
at Athens. It was discreetly calculated for their purpose, though
when we turn back to the commencement of the war, and read the lofty
declarations of the Spartan ephors and assembly respecting the
wrongs of their allies and the necessity of extorting full indemnity
for them from Athens, the contrast is indeed striking. On this
occasion, the Lacedæmonians acted entirely for themselves and from
consideration of their own necessities; severing themselves from
their allies, and soliciting a special peace for themselves, with as
little scruple as the Spartan general, Menedæus, during the preceding
year, when he abandoned his Ambrakiot confederates after the battle
of Olpæ, to conclude a separate capitulation with Demosthenês.</p>

<p>The course proper to be adopted by Athens in reference to
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[p. 328]</span> proposition,
however, was by no means obvious. In all probability, the trireme
which brought the Lacedæmonian envoys also brought the first news
of that unforeseen and instantaneous turn of events which had
rendered the Spartans in Sphakteria certain prisoners,—so it was
then conceived,—and placed the whole Lacedæmonian fleet in their
power; thus giving a totally new character of the war. The sudden
arrival of such prodigious intelligence,—the astounding presence of
Lacedæmonian envoys, bearing the olive-branch, and in an attitude of
humiliation,—must have produced in the susceptible public of Athens
emotions of the utmost intensity; an elation and confidence such as
had probably never been felt since the reconquest of Samos. It was
difficult at first to measure the full bearings of the new situation,
and even Periklês himself might have hesitated what to recommend: but
the immediate and dominant impression with the general public was,
that Athens might now ask her own terms, as consideration for the
prisoners in the island.<a id="FNanchor_526" href="#Footnote_526"
class="fnanchor">[526]</a> Of this reigning tendency Kleon<a
id="FNanchor_527" href="#Footnote_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a>
made himself the emphatic organ, as he had done three years before
in the sentence passed on the Mitylenæans; a man who—like leading
journals, in modern times—often appeared to guide the public because
he gave vehement utterance to that which they were already feeling,
and carried it out in its collateral bearings and consequences.
On the present occasion, he doubtless spoke with the most genuine
conviction; for he was full of the sentiment of Athenian force and
Athenian imperial dignity, as well as disposed to a sanguine view of
future chances. Moreover, in a discussion like that now opened, where
there was much room for doubt, he came forward with a proposition
at once plain and decisive. Reminding the Athenians of<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[p. 329]</span> the dishonorable truce
of thirty years to which they had been compelled by the misfortunes
of the time to accede, fourteen years before the Peloponnesian
war,—Kleon insisted that now was the time for Athens to recover what
she had then lost,—Nisæa, Pegæ, Trœzen, and Achaia. He proposed that
Sparta should be required to restore these to Athens, in exchange for
the soldiers now blocked up in Sphakteria; after which a truce might
be concluded for as long a time as might be deemed expedient.</p>

<p>This decree, adopted by the assembly, was communicated as the
answer of Athens to the Lacedæmonian envoys, who had probably retired
after their first address, and were now sent for again into the
assembly, to hear it. On being informed of the resolution, they
made no comment on its substance, but invited the Athenians to name
commissioners, who might discuss with them freely and deliberately
suitable terms for a pacification. Here, however, Kleon burst upon
them with an indignant rebuke. He had thought from the first, he
said, that they came with dishonest purposes, but now the thing was
clear,—nothing else could be meant by this desire to treat with some
few men apart from the general public. If they had really any fair
proposition to make, he called upon them to proclaim it openly to
all. But this the envoys could not bring themselves to do. They had
probably come with authority to make certain concessions, but to
announce these concessions forthwith would have rendered negotiation
impossible, besides dishonoring them in the face of their allies.
Such dishonor would be incurred, too, without any advantage, if
the Athenians should after all reject the terms, which the temper
of the assembly before them rendered but too probable. Moreover,
they were totally unpractised in the talents for dealing with a
public assembly, such discussions being so rare as to be practically
unknown in the Lacedæmonian system. To reply to the denunciation
of a vehement speaker like Kleon, required readiness of elocution,
dexterity, and self-command, which they had had no opportunity
of acquiring. They remained silent,—abashed by the speaker and
intimidated by the temper of the assembly: their mission was thus
terminated, and they were reconveyed in the trireme to Pylus.<a
id="FNanchor_528" href="#Footnote_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[p. 330]</span></p>
<p>It is probable that if these envoys had been able to make an
effective reply to Kleon, and to defend their proposition against
his charge of fraudulent purpose, they would have been sustained
by Nikias and a certain number of leading Athenians, so that the
assembly might have been brought at least to try the issue of a
private discussion between diplomatic agents on both sides. But
the case was one in which it was absolutely necessary that the
envoys should stand forward with some defence for themselves; which
Nikias might effectively second, but could not originate: and as
they were incompetent to this task, the whole affair broke down.
We shall hereafter find other examples, in which the incapacity
of Lacedæmonian envoys, to meet the open debate of Athenian
political life, is productive of mischievous results. In this case,
the proposition of the envoys to enter into treaty with select
commissioners, was not only quite reasonable, but afforded the
only possibility—though doubtless not a certainty—of some ultimate
pacification: and the manœuvre whereby Kleon discredited it was
a grave abuse of publicity, not unknown in modern, though more
frequent in ancient, political life. Kleon probably thought that
if commissioners were named, Nikias, Lachês, and other politicians
of the same rank and color, would be the persons selected; persons
whose anxiety for peace and alliance with Sparta would make them
over-indulgent and careless in securing the interests of Athens: and
it will be seen, when we come to describe the conduct of Nikias four
years afterwards, that this suspicion was not ill-grounded.</p>

<p>Unfortunately Thucydidês, in describing the proceedings of this
assembly, so important in its consequences because it intercepted a
promising opening for peace, is brief as usual,—telling us only what
was said by Kleon and what was decided by the assembly. But though
nothing is positively stated respecting Nikias and his partisans,
we learn from other sources, and we may infer from what afterwards
occurred, that they vehemently opposed Kleon, and that they looked
coldly on the subsequent enterprise against Sphakteria as upon
his peculiar measure.<a id="FNanchor_529" href="#Footnote_529"
class="fnanchor">[529]</a></p>

<p>It has been common to treat the dismissal of the Lacedæmonian
envoys on this occasion as a peculiar specimen of democrat<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[p. 331]</span>ical folly. But
over-estimation of the prospective chances arising out of success,
to a degree more extravagant than that of which Athens was now
guilty, is by no means peculiar to democracy. Other governments,
opposed to democracy not less in temper than in form,—an able
despot like the emperor Napoleon, and a powerful aristocracy
like that of England,<a id="FNanchor_530" href="#Footnote_530"
class="fnanchor">[530]</a>—have found success to the full as
misleading. That Athens should desire to profit by this unexpected
piece of good fortune, was perfectly reasonable: that she should make
use of it to regain advantages which former misfortunes had compelled
herself to surrender, was a feeling not unnatural. And whether the
demand was excessive, or by how much, is a question always among
the most embarrassing for any government—kingly, oligarchical, or
democratical—to determine.</p>

<p>We may, however, remark that Kleon gave an impolitic turn to
Athenian feeling, by directing it towards the entire and literal
reacquisition of what had been lost twenty years before. Unless we
are to consider his quadruple demand as a flourish, to be<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[p. 332]</span> modified by subsequent
negotiation, it seems to present some plausibility, but little of
long-sighted wisdom: for while, on the one hand, it called upon
Sparta to give up much which was not in her possession and must have
been extorted by force from allies,—on the other hand, the situation
of Athens was not the same as it had been when she concluded the
thirty years’ truce; nor does it seem that the restoration of Achaia
and Trœzen would have been of any material value to her. Nisæa and
Pegæ—which would have been tantamount to the entire Megarid, inasmuch
as Megara itself could hardly have been held with both its ports in
the possession of an enemy—would, indeed, have been highly valuable,
since she could then have protected her territory against invasion
from Peloponnesus, besides possessing a port in the Corinthian gulf.
And it would seem that if able commissioners had now been named for
private discussion with the Lacedæmonian envoys, under the present
urgent desire of Sparta, coupled with her disposition to abandon her
allies,—this important point might possibly have been pressed and
carried, in exchange for Sphakteria. Nay, even if such acquisition
had been found impracticable, still, the Athenians would have been
able to effect some arrangement which would have widened the breach,
and destroyed the confidence, between Sparta and her allies; a point
of great moment for them to accomplish. There was therefore every
reason for trying what could be done by negotiation, under the
present temper of Sparta; and the step, by which Kleon abruptly broke
off such hopes, was decidedly mischievous.</p>

<p>On the return of the envoys without success to Pylus,<a
id="FNanchor_531" href="#Footnote_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a>
twenty days after their departure from that place, the armistice
immediately terminated; and the Lacedæmonians redemanded the triremes
which they had surrendered. But Eurymedon refused compliance with
this demand, alleging that the Lacedæmonians had, during the truce,
made a fraudulent attempt to surprise the rock of Pylus, and had
violated the stipulations in other ways besides; while it stood
expressly stipulated in the truce, that the violation by either
side even of the least among its conditions, should cancel all
obligation on both sides. Thucydidês, without<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_333">[p. 333]</span> distinctly giving his opinion, seems
rather to imply, that there was no just ground for the refusal:
though if any accidental want of vigilance had presented to the
Lacedæmonians an opportunity for surprising Pylus, they would be
likely enough to avail themselves of it, seeing that they would
thereby drive off the Athenian fleet from its only landing-place,
and render the continued blockade of Sphakteria impracticable.
However the truth may be, Eurymedon persisted in his refusal, in
spite of loud protests of the Lacedæmonians against his perfidy.
Hostilities were energetically resumed: the Lacedæmonian army on
land began again to attack the fortifications of Pylus, while the
Athenian fleet became doubly watchful in the blockade of Sphakteria,
in which they were reinforced by twenty fresh ships from Athens,
making a fleet of seventy triremes in all. Two ships were perpetually
rowing round the island in opposite directions, throughout the whole
day; while at night, the whole fleet were kept on watch, except on
the sea-side of the island in stormy weather.<a id="FNanchor_532"
href="#Footnote_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a></p>

<p>The blockade, however, was soon found to be more full of privation
in reference to the besiegers themselves, and more difficult of
enforcement in respect to the island and its occupants, than had been
originally contemplated. The Athenians were much distressed for want
of water; they had only one really good spring in the fortification
of Pylus itself, quite insufficient for the supply of a large fleet:
many of them were obliged to scrape the shingle and drink such
brackish water as they could find; while ships as well as men were
perpetually afloat, since they could take rest and refreshment only
by relays successively landing on the rock of Pylus, or even on the
edge of Sphakteria itself, with all the chance of being interrupted
by the enemy,—there being no other landing-place,<a id="FNanchor_533"
href="#Footnote_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a> and the ancient
trireme affording no accommodation either for eating or sleeping. At
first, all this was patiently borne, in the hopes that Sphakteria
would speedily be starved out, and the Spartans forced to renew the
request for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[p. 334]</span>
capitulation: but no such request came, and the Athenians in the
fleet gradually became sick in body as well as impatient and angry
in mind. In spite of all their vigilance, clandestine supplies of
provisions continually reached the island, under the temptation
of large rewards offered by the Spartan government. Able swimmers
contrived to cross the strait, dragging after them by ropes skins
full of linseed and poppy-seed mixed with honey; while merchant
vessels, chiefly manned by Helots, started from various parts of
the Laconian coast, selecting by preference the stormy nights, and
encountering every risk in order to run their vessel with its cargo
ashore on the sea-side of the island, at a time when the Athenian
guard-ships could not be on the lookout.<a id="FNanchor_534"
href="#Footnote_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a> They cared little
about damage to their vessel in landing, provided they could get
the cargo on shore; for ample compensation was insured to them,
together with emancipation to every Helot who succeeded in reaching
the island with a supply. Though the Athenians redoubled their
vigilance, and intercepted many of these daring smugglers, still,
there were others who eluded them: moreover, the rations supplied to
the island by stipulation during the absence of the envoys in their
journey to Athens had been so ample, that Epitadas the commander had
been able to economize, and thus to make the stock hold out longer.
Week after week passed without any symptoms of surrender, and the
Athenians not only felt the present sufferings of their own position,
but also became apprehensive for their own supplies, all brought by
sea round Peloponnesus to this distant and naked shore. They began
even to mistrust the possibility of thus indefinitely continuing the
blockade against the contingencies of such violent weather, as would
probably ensue at the close of summer. In this state of weariness
and uncertainty, the active Demosthenês began to organize a descent
upon the island, with the view of carrying it by force. He not only
sent for forces from the neighboring allies, Zakynthus and Naupaktus,
but also transmitted an urgent request to Athens that reinforcements
might be furnished to him for the purpose, making known explicitly
both the uncomfortable condition of the armament, and the unpromising
chances of simple blockade.<a id="FNanchor_535" href="#Footnote_535"
class="fnanchor">[535]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[p. 335]</span></p>

<p>The arrival of these envoys caused infinite mortification to
the Athenians at home. Having expected to hear, long before, that
Sphakteria had surrendered, they were now taught to consider even
the ultimate conquest as a matter of doubt: they were surprised that
the Lacedæmonians sent no fresh envoys to solicit peace, and began
to suspect that such silence was founded upon well-grounded hopes of
being able to hold out. But the person most of all discomposed was
Kleon, who observed that the people now regretted their insulting
repudiation of the Lacedæmonian message, and were displeased with him
as the author of it; while, on the contrary, his numerous political
enemies were rejoiced at the turn which events had taken, as it
opened a means of effecting his ruin. At first, Kleon contended
that the envoys had misrepresented the state of facts; to which
the latter replied by entreating, that if their accuracy were
mistrusted, commissioners of inspection might be sent to verify it;
and Kleon himself, along with Theogonês, was forthwith named for this
function.</p>

<p>But it did not suit Kleon’s purpose to go as commissioner to
Pylus, since his mistrust of the statement was a mere general
suspicion, not resting on any positive evidence: moreover, he saw
that the dispositions of the assembly tended to comply with the
request of Demosthenês, and to despatch a reinforcing armament. He
accordingly altered his tone at once: “If ye really believe the story
(he said), do not waste time in sending commissioners, but sail at
once to capture the men. It would be easy with a proper force, if
our generals were <i>men</i> (here he pointed reproachfully to his enemy
Nikias, then stratêgus<a id="FNanchor_536" href="#Footnote_536"
class="fnanchor">[536]</a>), to sail and take the soldiers in the
island. That is what <i>I</i> at least would do, if <i>I</i> were general.”
His words instantly provoked a hostile murmur from a portion of
the assembly: “Why do you not sail then at once, if you think
the matter so easy?” while Nikias, taking<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_336">[p. 336]</span> up this murmur, and delighted to have
caught his political enemy in a trap, stood forward in person, and
pressed him to set about the enterprise without delay; intimating
the willingness of himself and his colleagues to grant him any
portion of the military force of the city which he chose to ask
for. Kleon at first closed with this proposition, believing it to
be a mere stratagem of debate and not seriously intended: but so
soon as he saw that what was said was really meant, he tried to
back out, and observed to Nikias: “It is your place to sail: <i>you</i>
are general, not I.”<a id="FNanchor_537" href="#Footnote_537"
class="fnanchor">[537]</a> Nikias only replied by repeating his
exhortation, renouncing formally the command against Sphakteria,
and calling upon the Athenians to recollect what Kleon had said,
as well as to hold him to his engagement. The more Kleon tried
to evade the duty, the louder and more unanimous did the cry of
the assembly become that Nikias should surrender it to him, and
that <i>he</i> should undertake it. At last, seeing that there was no
possibility of receding, Kleon reluctantly accepted the charge, and
came forward to announce his intention in a resolute address: “I
am not at all afraid of the Lacedæmonians (he said): I shall sail
without even taking with me any of the hoplites from the regular
Athenian muster-roll, but only the Lemnian and Imbrian hoplites who
are now here (that is, Athenian kleruchs or out-citizens who had
properties in Lemnos and Imbros, and habitually resided there),
together with some peltasts, brought from Ænos, in Thrace, and
four hundred bowmen. With this force, added to what is already
at Pylos, I engage in the space of twenty days either to bring
the Lacedæmonians in Sphakteria hither as prisoners, or to kill
them in the island.” The Athenians—observes Thucydidês—laughed
somewhat at Kleon’s looseness of tongue; but<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_337">[p. 337]</span> prudent men had pleasure in reflecting
that one or other of the two advantages was now certain: either
they would get rid of Kleon, which they anticipated as the issue
at once most probable and most desirable,—or, if mistaken on this
point, the Lacedæmonians in the island would be killed or taken.<a
id="FNanchor_538" href="#Footnote_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a> The
vote was accordingly passed for the immediate departure of Kleon, who
caused Demosthenês to be named as his colleague in command, and sent
intelligence to Pylus at once that he was about to start with the
reinforcement solicited.</p>

<p>This curious scene, interesting as laying open the interior
feeling of the Athenian assembly, suggests, when properly considered,
reflections very different from those which have been usually
connected with it. It seems to be conceived by most historians as
a mere piece of levity or folly in the Athenian people, who are
supposed to have enjoyed the excellent joke of putting an incompetent
man against his own will at the head of this enterprise, in order
that they might amuse themselves with his blunders: Kleon is thus
contemptible, and the Athenian people ridiculous. Certainly, if that
people had been disposed to conduct their public business upon such
childish fancies as are here implied, they would have made a very
different figure from that which history actually presents to us.
The truth is, that in regard to Kleon’s alleged looseness of tongue,
which excited more or less of laughter among the persons present,
there was no one really ridiculous except the laughers themselves:
for the announcement which he made was so far from being extravagant,
that it was realized to the letter, and realized, too, let us
add, without any peculiar aid from unforeseen favorable accident.
To show how much this is the case, we have only to contrast the
jesters before the fact with the jesters after it. While the former
deride Kleon as a promiser of extravagant and impossible results,
we find Aristophanês, in his comedy of the Knights, about six<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[p. 338]</span> months afterwards,<a
id="FNanchor_539" href="#Footnote_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a>
laughing at him as having achieved nothing at all,—as having
cunningly put himself into the shoes of Demosthenês, and stolen away
from that general the glory of taking Sphakteria, after all the
difficulties of the enterprise had been already got over, and “the
cake ready baked,”—to use the phrase of the comic poet. Both of the
jests are exaggerations in opposite directions; but the last in order
of time, if it be good at all against Kleon, is a galling sarcasm
against those who derided Kleon as an extravagant boaster.</p>

<p>If we intend fairly to compare the behavior of Kleon with that
of his political adversaries, we must distinguish between the two
occasions: first, that in which he had frustrated the pacific
mission of the Lacedæmonian envoys; next, the subsequent delay and
dilemma which has been recently described. On the first occasion,
his advice appears to have been mistaken in policy, as well as
offensive in manner: his opponents, proposing a discussion by special
commissioners as a fair chance for honorable terms of peace, took
a juster view of the public interests. But the case was entirely
altered when the mission for peace (wisely or unwisely) had been
broken up, and when the fate of Sphakteria had been committed to the
chances of war. There were then imperative reasons for prosecuting
the war vigorously, and for employing all the force requisite to
insure the capture of that island. And looking to this end, we shall
find that there was nothing in the conduct of Kleon either to blame
or to deride; while his political adversaries, Nikias among them, are
deplorably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[p. 339]</span> timid,
ignorant, and reckless of the public interest; seeking only to turn
the existing disappointment and dilemma into a party opportunity for
ruining him.</p>

<p>To grant the reinforcement asked for by Demosthenês was obviously
the proper measure, and Kleon saw that the people would go along
with him in proposing it: but he had at the same time good grounds
for reproaching Nikias, and the other stratêgi, whose duty it was
to originate that proposition, with their backwardness in remaining
silent, and in leaving the matter to go by default, as if it were
Kleon’s affair and not theirs. His taunt: “This is what <i>I</i> would
have done, if <i>I</i> were general,” was a mere phrase of the heat of
debate, such as must have been very often used, without any idea
on the part of the hearers of construing it as a pledge which the
speaker was bound to realize: nor was it any disgrace to Kleon to
decline a charge which he had never sought, and to confess his
incompetence to command. The reason why he was forced into the
post, in spite of his own unaffected reluctance, was not, as some
historians would have us believe, because the Athenian people loved
a joke, but from two feelings, both perfectly serious, which divided
the assembly,—feelings opposite in their nature, but coinciding
on this occasion to the same result. His enemies loudly urged him
forward, anticipating that the enterprise under him would miscarry,
and that he would thus be ruined: his friends, perceiving this
manœuvre, but not sharing in such anticipations, and ascribing
his reluctance to modesty, pronounced themselves so much the more
vehemently on behalf of their leader, and repaid the scornful cheer
by cheers of sincere encouragement. “Why do you not try your hand at
this enterprise, Kleon, if you think it so easy? You will soon find
that it is too much for you;” was the cry of his enemies: to which
his friends would reply: “Yes, to be sure, try, Kleon: by all means,
try: do not be backward; we warrant that you will come honorably out
of it, and we will stand by you.” Such cheer and counter-cheer is
precisely in the temper of an animated multitude, as Thucydidês<a
id="FNanchor_540" href="#Footnote_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a>
states it, divided in feeling; and friends as well as enemies thus
concurred to impose upon Kleon a compulsion not to be eluded. Of all
the parties<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[p. 340]</span> here
concerned those whose conduct is the most unpardonably disgraceful
are Nikias and his oligarchical friends; who force a political enemy
into a supreme command against his own strenuous protest, persuaded
that he will fail so as to compromise the lives of many soldiers, and
the destinies of the state on an important emergency,—but satisfying
themselves with the idea that they shall bring him to disgrace and
ruin.</p>

<p>It is to be remarked, that Nikias and his fellow stratêgi were
backward on this occasion, partly because they were really afraid of
the duty. They anticipated a resistance to the death at Sphakteria,
such as that at Thermopylæ: in which case, though victory might
perhaps be won by a superior assailant force, it would not be won
without much bloodshed and peril, besides an inexpiable quarrel with
Sparta. If Kleon took a more correct measure of the chances, he ought
to have credit for it, as one “bene ausus vana contemnere.” And it
seems probable, that if he had not been thus forward in supporting
the request of Demosthenês for reinforcement,—or rather, if he had
not been so placed that he was compelled to be forward,—Nikias and
his friends would have laid aside the enterprise, and reopened
negotiations for peace, under circumstances neither honorable nor
advantageous to Athens. Kleon was in this manner one main author of
the most important success which Athens obtained throughout the whole
war.</p>

<p>On joining Demosthenês with his reinforcement, Kleon found every
preparation for attack made by that general, and the soldiers at
Pylus eager to commence such aggressive measures as would relieve
them from the tedium of a blockade. Sphakteria had become recently
more open to assault in consequence of an accidental conflagration
of the wood, arising from a fire kindled by the Athenian seamen,
while landing at the skirt of the island, and cooking their food:
under the influence of a strong wind, most of the wood in the island
had thus caught fire and been destroyed. To Demosthenês this was an
accident especially welcome; for the painful experience of his defeat
in the forest-covered hills of Ætolia had taught him how difficult
it was for assailants to cope with an enemy whom they could not
see, and who knew all the good points of defence in the country.<a
id="FNanchor_541" href="#Footnote_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a>
The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[p. 341]</span> island being
thus stripped of its wood, he was enabled to survey the garrison, to
count their number, and to lay his plan of attack on certain data. He
now, too, for the first time, discovered that he had underrated their
real number, having before suspected that the Lacedæmonians had sent
in rations for a greater total than was actually there. The island
was occupied altogether by four hundred and twenty Lacedæmonian
hoplites, out of whom more than one hundred and twenty were native
Spartans, belonging to the first families in the city. The commander,
Epitadas, with the main body, occupied the centre of the island,
near the only spring of water which it afforded:<a id="FNanchor_542"
href="#Footnote_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a> an advanced guard
of thirty hoplites was posted not far from the sea-shore, in the
end of the island farthest from Pylus; while the end immediately
fronting Pylus, peculiarly steep and rugged, and containing even a
rude circuit of stones, of unknown origin, which served as a sort
of defence, was held as a post of reserve.<a id="FNanchor_543"
href="#Footnote_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a></p>

<p>Such was the prey which Kleon and Demosthenês were anxious to
grasp. On the very day of the arrival of the former, they sent a
herald to the Lacedæmonian generals on the mainland, inviting the
surrender of the hoplites on the island, on condition of being simply
detained under guard without any hardship, until a final pacification
should take place. Of course the summons was refused; after which,
leaving only one day for repose, the two generals took advantage of
the night to put all their hoplites aboard a few triremes, making
show as if they were merely commencing the ordinary nocturnal
circumnavigation, so as to excite no suspicion in the occupants of
the island. The entire body of Athenian hoplites, eight hundred in
number, were thus disembarked in two divisions, one on each side
of the island, a little before daybreak: the advanced guard of
thirty Lacedæmonians, completely unprepared, were surprised even in
their sleep and all slain.<a id="FNanchor_544" href="#Footnote_544"
class="fnanchor">[544]</a> At the point of day, the entire remaining
force from the seventy-two triremes was also disembarked, leaving
on board only the thalamii, or lowest tier of rowers, and<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[p. 342]</span> reserving only a
sufficient number to man the walls of Pylus. Altogether, there
could not have been less than ten thousand troops employed in the
attack of the island,—men of all arms: eight hundred hoplites, eight
hundred peltasts, eight hundred bowmen; the rest armed with javelins,
slings, and stones. Demosthenês kept his hoplites in one compact
body, but distributed the light-armed into separate companies of
about two hundred men each, with orders to occupy the rising grounds
all round, and harass the flanks and rear of the Lacedæmonians.<a
id="FNanchor_545" href="#Footnote_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a></p>

<p>To resist this large force, the Lacedæmonian commander Epitadas
had only three hundred and sixty hoplites around him; for his
advanced guard of thirty men had been slain, and as many more must
have been held in reserve to guard the rocky station in his rear:
of the Helots who were with him, Thucydidês says nothing, during
the whole course of the action. As soon as he saw the numbers and
disposition of his enemies, Epitadas placed his men in battle
array, and advanced to encounter the main body of hoplites whom
he saw before him. But the Spartan march was habitually slow:<a
id="FNanchor_546" href="#Footnote_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a>
moreover, the ground was rough and uneven, obstructed with stumps,
and overlaid with dust and ashes, from the recently burnt wood, so
that a march at once rapid and orderly was hardly possible: and he
had to traverse the whole intermediate space, since the Athenian
hoplites remained immovable in their position. No sooner had his
march commenced, than he found himself assailed both in rear and
flanks, especially in the right or unshielded flank, by the numerous
companies of light-armed.<a id="FNanchor_547" href="#Footnote_547"
class="fnanchor">[547]</a> Notwithstanding their extraordinary
superiority of number, these men were at first awe-stricken at
finding themselves in actual contest with Lacedæmonian hoplites:<a
id="FNanchor_548" href="#Footnote_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a>
still, they began the fight, poured in their missile weapons, and
so annoyed the march that the hoplites were obliged to halt, while
Epitadas ordered the most active among them to spring out of their
ranks and repel the assailants. But pursuers with spear and shield
had little chance of overtaking men lightly clad and armed, who
always retired, in whatever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[p.
343]</span> direction the pursuit was commenced, had the advantage
of difficult ground, redoubled their annoyance against the rear of
the pursuers as soon as the latter retreated to resume their place
in the ranks, and always took care to get round to the rear of the
hoplites.</p>

<p>After some experience of the inefficacy of Lacedæmonian pursuit,
the light-armed, becoming far bolder than at first, closed upon them
nearer and more universally, with arrows, javelins, and stones,
raising shouts and clamor that rent the air, rendering the word of
command inaudible by the Lacedæmonian soldiers, who at the same time
were almost blinded by the thick clouds of dust, kicked up from the
recently spread wood-ashes.<a id="FNanchor_549" href="#Footnote_549"
class="fnanchor">[549]</a> Such method of fighting was one for which
the Lykurgean drill made no provision, and the longer it continued
the more painful did the embarrassment of the exposed hoplites
become: their repeated efforts to destroy or even to reach nimble
and ever-returning enemies, all proved abortive, whilst their own
numbers were incessantly diminished by wounds which they could not
return. Their only offensive arms consisted of the long spear and
short sword usual to the Grecian hoplite, without any missile weapons
whatever; nor could they even pick up and throw back the javelins
of their enemies, since the points of these javelins commonly broke
off and stuck in the shields, or sometimes even in the body which
they had wounded. Moreover, the bows of the archers, doubtless
carefully selected before starting from Athens, were powerfully
drawn, so that their arrows may sometimes have pierced and inflicted
wounds even through the shield or the helmet,—but at any rate, the
stuffed doublet, which formed the only defence of the hoplite on his
unshielded side, was a very inadequate protection against them.<a
id="FNanchor_550" href="#Footnote_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a>
Under this trying distress<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[p.
344]</span> did the Lacedæmonians continue for a long time, poorly
provided for defence, and altogether helpless for aggression,—without
being able to approach at all nearer to the Athenian hoplites. At
length the Lacedæmonian commander, seeing that his position grew
worse and worse, gave orders to close the ranks and retreat to the
last redoubt in the rear: but this movement was not accomplished
without difficulty, for the light-armed assailants became doubly
clamorous and forward, and many wounded men, unable to move, or at
least to keep in rank, were overtaken and slain.<a id="FNanchor_551"
href="#Footnote_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a></p>

<p>A diminished remnant, however, reached the last post in safety,
and they were here in comparative protection, since the ground was
so rocky and impracticable that their enemies could not attack them
either in flank or rear: though the position at any rate could not
have been long tenable separately, inasmuch as the only spring of
water in the island was in the centre, which they had just been
compelled to abandon. The light-armed being now less available,
Demosthenês and Kleon brought up their eight hundred Athenian
hoplites, who had not before been engaged; but the Lacedæmonians
were here at home<a id="FNanchor_552" href="#Footnote_552"
class="fnanchor">[552]</a> with their weapons, and enabled to display
their well-known superiority against opposing hoplites, especially
as they had the advantage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[p.
345]</span> of higher ground against enemies charging from beneath.
Although the Athenians were double their own numbers and withal yet
unexhausted, they were repulsed in many successive attacks. The
besieged maintained their ground in spite of all their previous
fatigue and suffering, harder to be borne from the scanty diet on
which they had recently subsisted. The struggle lasted so long
that heat and thirst began to tell even upon the assailants, when
the commander of the Messenians came to Kleon and Demosthenês, and
intimated that they were now laboring in vain; promising at the same
time that if they would confide to him a detachment of light troops
and bowmen, he would find his way round to the higher cliffs, in the
rear of the assailants.<a id="FNanchor_553" href="#Footnote_553"
class="fnanchor">[553]</a> He accordingly stole away unobserved from
the rear, scrambling round over pathless crags, and by an almost
impracticable footing on the brink of the sea, amidst approaches
which the Lacedæmonians had left unguarded, never imagining that they
could be molested in that direction. He suddenly appeared with his
detachment on the higher peak above them, so that their position was
thus commanded, and they found themselves, as at Thermopylæ, between
two fires, without any hope of escape. Their enemies in front,
encouraged by the success of the Messenians, pressed forward with
increased ardor, until at length the courage of the Lacedæmonians
gave way, and the position was carried.<a id="FNanchor_554"
href="#Footnote_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a></p>

<p>A few moments more, and they would have been all overpowered and
slain, when Kleon and Demosthenês, anxious to carry them as prisoners
to Athens, constrained their men to halt, and proclaimed by herald
an invitation to surrender, on condition of delivering up their
arms and being held at the disposal of the Athenians. Most of them,
incapable of farther effort, closed with the proposition forthwith,
signifying compliance by dropping their shields and waving both
hands above their heads. The battle being thus ended, Styphon the
commander—originally only third in command, but now chief, since
Epitadas had been slain, and the second in command, Hippagretês,
was lying disabled by wounds on the field—entered into conference
with Kleon and Demosthenês, and entreated permission to send across
for orders to the Lacedæmonians on the mainland. The Athe<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[p. 346]</span>nian commanders, though
refusing this request, sent themselves and invited Lacedæmonian
heralds over from the mainland, through whom communications were
exchanged twice or three times between Styphon and the chief
Lacedæmonian authorities. At length the final message came: “The
Lacedæmonians direct you to take counsel for yourselves, but to
do nothing disgraceful.”<a id="FNanchor_555" href="#Footnote_555"
class="fnanchor">[555]</a> Their counsel was speedily taken; they
surrendered themselves and delivered up their arms; two hundred and
ninety-two in number, the survivors of the original total of four
hundred and twenty. And out of these, no less than one hundred and
twenty were native Spartans, some of them belonging to the first
families in the city.<a id="FNanchor_556" href="#Footnote_556"
class="fnanchor">[556]</a> They were kept under guard during that
night, and distributed on the morrow among the Athenian trierarchs
to be conveyed as prisoners to Athens; while a truce was granted
to the Lacedæmonians on shore, in order that they might carry
across the dead bodies for burial. So careful had Epitadas been
in husbanding the provisions, that some food was yet found in the
island; though the garrison had subsisted for fifty-two days upon
casual supplies, aided by such economies as had been laid by during
the twenty days of the armistice, when food of a stipulated quantity
was regularly furnished. Seventy-two days had thus elapsed, from the
first imprisonment in the island to the hour of their surrender.<a
id="FNanchor_557" href="#Footnote_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a></p>

<p>The best troops in modern times would neither incur reproach,
nor occasion surprise, by surrendering, under circumstances in all
respects similar to this gallant remnant in Sphakteria. Yet in
Greece the astonishment was prodigious and universal, when it was
learned that the Lacedæmonians had consented to become prisoners:<a
id="FNanchor_558" href="#Footnote_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a> for
the terror inspired by their name, and the deep-struck impression
of Thermopylæ, had created a belief that they would endure any
extremity of famine, and perish in the midst of any superiority
of hostile force, rather than dream of giving up their arms and
surviving as captives. The events of Sphak<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_347">[p. 347]</span>teria, shocking as they did this
preconceived idea, discredited the military prowess of Sparta in the
eyes of all Greece, and especially in those of her own allies. Even
in Sparta itself, too, the same feeling prevailed,—partially revealed
in the answer transmitted to Styphon from the generals on shore,
who did not venture to forbid surrender, yet discountenanced it by
implication: and it is certain that the Spartans would have lost less
by their death than by their surrender. But we read with disgust
the spiteful taunt of one of the allies of Athens (not an Athenian)
engaged in the affair, addressed in the form of a question to one of
the prisoners: “Have your best men then been all slain?” The reply
conveyed an intimation of the standing contempt entertained by the
Lacedæmonians for the bow and its chance-strokes in the line: “That
would be a capital arrow which could single out the best man.” The
language which Herodotus puts into the mouth of Demaratus, composed
in the early years of the Peloponnesian war, attests this same belief
in Spartan valor: “The Lacedæmonians die, but never surrender.”<a
id="FNanchor_559" href="#Footnote_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a>
Such impression was from henceforward, not indeed effaced, but
sensibly enfeebled, and never again was it restored to its former
pitch.</p>

<p>But the general judgment of the Greeks respecting the capture
of Sphakteria, remarkable as it is to commemorate, is far less
surprising than that pronounced by Thucydidês himself. Kleon and
Demosthenês returning with a part of the squadron and carrying all
the prisoners, started from Sphakteria on the next day but one after
the action, and reached Athens within twenty days after Kleon had
left it. Thus, “the promise of Kleon, <i>insane as it was</i>, came true,”
observes the historian.<a id="FNanchor_560" href="#Footnote_560"
class="fnanchor">[560]</a></p> <p><span class="pagenum"
id="Page_348">[p. 348]</span></p> <p>Men with arms in their hands
have always the option between death and imprisonment, and Grecian
opinion was only mistaken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[p.
349]</span> in assuming as a certainty that the Lacedæmonians would
choose the former. But Kleon had never promised to bring them home as
prisoners: his promise was disjunctive,—that they should be either
so brought home, or slain, within twenty days: and no sentence
throughout the whole of Thucydidês astonishes me so much as that
in which he stigmatizes such an expectation as “insane.” Here are
four hundred and twenty Lacedæmonian hoplites, without any other
description of troops to aid them,—without the possibility of being
reinforced,—without any regular fortification,—without any narrow
pass, such as that of Thermopylæ,—without either a sufficient or
a certain supply of food,—cooped up in a small open island less
than two miles in length. Against them are brought ten thousand
troops of diverse arms, including eight hundred fresh hoplites from
Athens, and marshalled by Demosthenês, a man alike enterprising and
experienced: for the talents as well as the presence and preparations
of Demosthenês are a part of the data of the case, and the personal
competence of Kleon to command alone, is foreign to the calculation.
Now if, under such circumstances, Kleon engaged that this forlorn
company of brave men should be either slain or taken prisoners, how
could he be looked upon, I will not say as indulging in an insane
boast, but even as overstepping the most cautious and mistrustful
estimate of probability? Even to doubt of this result, much more
to pronounce such an opinion as that of Thucydidês, implies an
idea not only of superhuman power in the Lacedæmonian hoplites,
but of disgraceful cowardice on the part of Demosthenês and the
assailants. Nor was the interval of twenty days, named by Kleon, at
all extravagantly narrow, considering the distance of Athens from
Pylus: for the attack of this petty island could not possibly occupy
more than one or two days at the utmost, though the blockade of
it might by various accidents have been prolonged, or might even,
by some terrible storm, be altogether broken off. If, then, we
carefully consider this promise made by Kleon in the assembly, we
shall find that so far from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[p.
350]</span> deserving the sentence pronounced upon it by Thucydidês,
of being a mad boast which came true by accident, it was a reasonable
and even a modest anticipation of the future:<a id="FNanchor_561"
href="#Footnote_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a> reserving the only
really doubtful point in the case, whether the garrison of the island
would be ultimately slain or made prisoners. Demosthenês, had he been
present at Athens instead of being at Pylus, would willingly have set
his seal to the engagement taken by Kleon.</p>

<p>I repeat with reluctance, though not without belief, the statement
made by one of the biographers of Thucydidês,<a id="FNanchor_562"
href="#Footnote_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a> that Kleon was the
cause of the banishment of the latter as a general, and has therefore
received from him harder measure than was due in his capacity
of historian. But though this sentiment is not probably without
influence in dictating the unaccountable judgment which I have just
been criticizing,—as well as other opinions relative to Kleon, on
which I shall say more in a future chapter,—I nevertheless look upon
that judgment not as peculiar to Thucydidês, but as common to him
with Nikias and those whom we must call, for want of a better name,
the oligarchical party of the time at Athens. And it gives us some
measure of the prejudice and narrowness of vision which prevailed
among that party at the present memorable crisis; so pointedly
contrasting with the clear-sighted and resolute calculations, and the
judicious conduct in action, of Kleon, who, when forced against his
will into the post of general, did the very best which could be done
in his situation,—he selected Demosthenês as colleague and heartily
seconded his operations. Though the military attack of Sphakteria,
one of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[p. 351]</span> ablest
specimens of generalship in the whole war, and distinguished not less
by the dextrous employment of different descriptions of troops, than
by care to spare the lives of the assailants,—belongs altogether
to Demosthenês, yet if Kleon had not been competent to stand up
in the Athenian assembly and defy those gloomy predictions which
we see attested in Thucydidês, Demosthenês would never have been
reinforced nor placed in condition to land on the island. The glory
of the enterprise, therefore, belongs jointly to both: and Kleon,
far from stealing away the laurels of Demosthenês (as Aristophanês
represents, in his comedy of the Knights), was really the means of
placing them on his head, though he at the same time deservedly
shared them. It has hitherto been the practice to look at Kleon only
from the point of view of his opponents, through whose testimony
we know him: but the real fact is, that this history of the events
of Sphakteria, when properly surveyed, is a standing disgrace to
those opponents and no inconsiderable honor to him; exhibiting them
as alike destitute of political foresight and of straightforward
patriotism,—as sacrificing the opportunities of war, along with the
lives of their fellow-citizens and soldiers, for the purpose of
ruining a political enemy. It was the duty of Nikias, as stratêgus,
to propose, and undertake in person if necessary, the reduction of
Sphakteria: if he thought the enterprise dangerous, that was a good
reason for assigning to it a larger military force, as we shall find
him afterwards reasoning about the Sicilian expedition,—but not for
letting it slip or throwing it off upon others.<a id="FNanchor_563"
href="#Footnote_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a></p>

<p>The return of Kleon and Demosthenês to Athens, within the twenty
days promised, bringing with them near three hundred Lacedæmonian
prisoners, must have been by far the most triumphant and exhilarating
event which had occurred to the Athenians throughout the whole war.
It at once changed the prospects, position, and feelings of both
the contending parties. Such a number of Lacedæmonian prisoners,
especially one hundred and twenty Spartans, was a source of
almost stupefaction to the general body of Greeks, and a prize of
inestimable value to the captors. The return of Demosthenês in the
preceding year from the Ambrakian gulf, when he brought with him
three hun<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[p. 352]</span>dred
Ambrakian panoplies, had probably been sufficiently triumphant;
but the entry into Peiræus on this occasion from Sphakteria, with
three hundred Lacedæmonian prisoners, must doubtless have occasioned
emotions transcending all former experience; and it is much to be
regretted that no description is preserved to us of the scene, as
well as of the elate manifestations of the people when the prisoners
were marched up from Peiræus to Athens. We should be curious, also,
to read some account of the first Athenian assembly held after this
event,—the overwhelming cheers heaped upon Kleon by his joyful
partisans, who had helped to invest him with the duties of general,
in confidence that he would discharge them well,—contrasted with the
silence or retraction of Nikias, and the other humiliated political
enemies. But all such details are unfortunately denied to us, though
they constitute the blood and animation of Grecian history, now lying
before us only in its skeleton.</p>

<p>The first impulse of the Athenians was to regard the prisoners as
a guarantee to their territory against invasion:<a id="FNanchor_564"
href="#Footnote_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a> they resolved to
keep them securely guarded until the peace, but if, at any time
before that event, the Lacedæmonian army should enter Attica, to
bring forth the prisoners and put them to death in sight of the
invaders. They were at the same time full of spirits in regard to
the prosecution of the war, and became farther confirmed in the
hope, not merely of preserving their power undiminished, but even
of recovering much of what they had lost before the thirty years’
truce. Pylus was placed in an improved state of defence, with the
adjoining island of Sphakteria, doubtless as a subsidiary occupation:
the Messenians, transferred thither from Naupaktus, and overjoyed to
find themselves once more masters even of an outlying rock of their
ancestorial territory, began with alacrity to overrun and ravage
Laconia, while the Helots, shaken by the recent events, manifested
inclination to desert to them. The Lacedæmonian authorities,
experiencing evils before unfelt and unknown, became sensibly alarmed
lest such desertions should spread through the country. Reluctant
as they were to afford obvious evidence of their embarrassments,
they nevertheless brought themselves, probably under the pressure
of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[p. 353]</span> friends
and relatives of the Sphakterian captives, to send to Athens several
missions for peace; but all proved abortive.<a id="FNanchor_565"
href="#Footnote_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a> We are not told what
they offered, but it did not come up to the expectations which the
Athenians thought themselves entitled to indulge.</p>

<p>We, who now review these facts with a knowledge of the subsequent
history, see that the Athenians could have concluded a better bargain
with the Lacedæmonians during the six or eight months succeeding
the capture of Sphakteria, than it was ever open to them to make
afterwards; and they had reason to repent that they let slip the
opportunity. Perhaps also Periklês, had he been still alive, might
have taken the same prudent measure of the future, and might have had
ascendency enough over his countrymen to be able to arrest the tide
of success at its highest point, before it began to ebb again. But if
we put ourselves back into the situation of Athens during the autumn
which succeeded the return of Kleon and Demosthenês from Sphakteria,
we shall easily enter into the feelings under which the war was
continued. The actual possession of the captives now placed Athens
in a far better position than she had occupied at a time when they
were only blocked up in Sphakteria, and when the Lacedæmonian envoys
first arrived to ask for peace. She was now certain of being able to
command peace with Sparta on terms at least tolerable, whenever she
chose to invite it,—she had also a fair certainty of escaping the
hardship of invasion. Next, and this was perhaps the most important
feature of the case, the apprehension of Lacedæmonian prowess was now
greatly lowered, and the prospects of success to Athens considered
as prodigiously improved,<a id="FNanchor_566" href="#Footnote_566"
class="fnanchor">[566]</a> even in the estimation of impartial
Greeks; much more in the eyes of the Athenians themselves. Moreover,
the idea of a tide of good fortune, of the favor of the gods, now
begun and likely to continue, of future success as a corollary
from past, was one which powerfully affected Grecian calculations
generally. Why not push the present good fortune, and try to regain
the most important points lost before and by the thirty years’ truce,
especially in Megara and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[p.
354]</span> Bœotia,—points which Sparta could not concede by
negotiation, since they were not in her possession? Though these
speculations failed, as we shall see in the coming chapter, yet there
was nothing unreasonable in undertaking them. Probably, the almost
universal sentiment of Athens was at this moment warlike,—and even
Nikias, humiliated as he must have been by the success in Sphakteria,
would forget his usual caution in the desire of retrieving his own
personal credit by some military exploit. That Demosthenês, now in
full measure of esteem, would be eager to prosecute the war, with
which his prospects of personal glory were essentially associated,
just as Thucydidês<a id="FNanchor_567" href="#Footnote_567"
class="fnanchor">[567]</a> observes about Brasidas on the
Lacedæmonian side, can admit of no doubt. The comedy of Aristophanês,
called the Acharnians, was acted about six months before the affair
of Sphakteria, when no one could possibly look forward to such an
event,—the comedy of the Knights, about six months after it.<a
id="FNanchor_568" href="#Footnote_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a>
Now, there is this remarkable difference between the two,—that
while the former breathes the greatest sickness of war, and presses
in every possible way the importance of making peace, although at
that time Athens had an opportunity of coming even to a decent
accommodation,—the latter, running down Kleon with unmeasured scorn
and ridicule, talks in one or two places only of the hardships of
war, and drops altogether that emphasis and repetition with which
peace had been dwelt upon in the Acharnians,—although coming out at a
time when peace was within the reach of the Athenians.</p>

<p>To understand properly the history of this period, therefore,
we must distinguish various occasions which are often confounded.
At the moment when Sphakteria was first blockaded, and when the
Lacedæmonians first sent to solicit peace, there was a considerable
party at Athens disposed to entertain the offer, and the ascendency
of Kleon was one of the main causes why it was<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_355">[p. 355]</span> rejected. But after the captives
were brought home from Sphakteria, the influence of Kleon, though
positively greater than it had been before, was no longer required
to procure the dismissal of Lacedæmonian pacific offers and the
continuance of the war: the general temper of Athens was then
warlike, and there were very few to contend strenuously for an
opposite policy. During the ensuing year, however, the chances of war
turned out mostly unfavorable to Athens, so that by the end of that
year she had become much more disposed to peace.<a id="FNanchor_569"
href="#Footnote_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a> The truce for one
year was then concluded,—but even after that truce was expired,
Kleon still continued eager, and on good grounds, as will be shown
hereafter, for renewing the war in Thrace, at a time when a large
proportion of the Athenian public had grown weary of it. He was
one of the main causes of that resumption of warlike operations,
which ended in the battle of Amphipolis, fatal both to himself and
to Brasidas. There were thus two distinct occasions on which the
personal influence and sanguine character of Kleon seems to have been
of sensible moment in determining the Athenian public to war instead
of peace. But at the moment which we have now reached, that is, the
year immediately following the capture of Sphakteria, the Athenians
were all sufficiently warlike without him; probably Nikias himself as
well as the rest.</p>

<p>It was one of the earliest proceedings of Nikias, immediately
after the inglorious exhibition which he had made in reference
to Sphakteria, to conduct an expedition, in conjunction with two
colleagues, against the Corinthian territory: he took with him eighty
triremes, two thousand Athenian hoplites, two hundred horsemen aboard
of some horse transports, and some additional hoplites from Milêtus,
Andros, and Karystus.<a id="FNanchor_570" href="#Footnote_570"
class="fnanchor">[570]</a> Starting from Peiræus in the evening, he
arrived a little before daybreak on a beach at the foot of the hill
and village of Solygeia,<a id="FNanchor_571" href="#Footnote_571"
class="fnanchor">[571]</a> about seven miles from Corinth, and
two or three miles south of the isthmus.<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_356">[p. 356]</span> The Corinthian troops, from all the
territory of Corinth, within the isthmus, were already assembled at
the isthmus itself to repel him; for intelligence of the intended
expedition had reached Corinth some time before from Argos, with
which latter place the scheme of the expedition may have been in
some way connected. The Athenians having touched the coast during
the darkness, the Corinthians were only apprized of the fact by
fire-signals from Solygeia. Not being able to hinder the landing,
they despatched forthwith half their forces, under Battus and
Lykophron, to repel the invader, while the remaining half were left
at the harbor of Kenchreæ, on the northern side of Mount Oneion, to
guard the port of Krommyon, outside of the isthmus, in case it should
be attacked by sea. Battus with one lochus of hoplites threw himself
into the village of Solygeia, which was unfortified, while Lykophron
conducted the remaining troops to attack the Athenians. The battle
was first engaged on the Athenian right, almost immediately after its
landing, on the point called Chersonesus. Here the Athenian hoplites,
together with their Karystian allies, repelled the Corinthian attack,
after a stout and warmly disputed hand-combat of spear and shield:
but the Corinthians, retreating up to a higher point of ground,
returned to the charge, and with the aid of a fresh lochus, drove
the Athenians back to the shore and to their ships: from hence the
latter again turned, and again recovered a partial advantage.<a
id="FNanchor_572" href="#Footnote_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a>
The battle was no less severe on the left wing of the Athenians:
but here, after a contest of some length, the latter gained a more
decided victory, greatly by the aid of their cavalry,—pursuing the
Corinthians, who fled in some disorder to a neighboring hill and
there took up a position.<a id="FNanchor_573" href="#Footnote_573"
class="fnanchor">[573]</a> The Athenians were thus victorious
throughout the whole line, with the loss of about forty-seven men,
while the Corinthians had lost two hundred and twelve, together with
the general Lykophron. The victors erected their trophy, stripped the
dead bodies, and buried their own dead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[p. 357]</span></p>

<p>The Corinthian detachment left at Kenchreæ could not see the
battle, in consequence of the interposing ridge of Mount Oneium:
but it was at last made known to them by the dust of the fugitives,
and they forthwith hastened to help. Reinforcements also came both
from Corinth and from Kenchreæ, and as it seemed, too, from the
neighboring Peloponnesian cities, so that Nikias thought it prudent
to retire aboard his ships, and halt upon some neighboring islands.
It was here first discovered that two of the Athenians slain had
not been picked up for burial; upon which he immediately sent a
herald to solicit a truce, in order to procure these two missing
bodies. We have here a remarkable proof of the sanctity attached
to that duty; for the mere sending of the herald was tantamount
to confession of defeat.<a id="FNanchor_574" href="#Footnote_574"
class="fnanchor">[574]</a></p>

<p>From hence Nikias sailed to Krommyon, where he ravaged the
neighborhood for a few hours and rested for the night. On the
next day he reëmbarked, sailed along the coast of Epidaurus, upon
which he inflicted some damage in passing, and stopped at last
on the peninsula of Methana, between Epidaurus and Trœzen.<a
id="FNanchor_575" href="#Footnote_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a>
On this peninsula he established a permanent garrison, drawing a
fortification across the narrow neck of land which joined it to the
Epidaurian peninsula. This was his last exploit, and he then sailed
home: but the post at Methana long remained as a centre for pillaging
the neighboring regions of Epidaurus, Trœzen, and Halieis.</p>

<p id="Istone">While Nikias was engaged in this expedition,
Eurymedon and Sophoklês had sailed forward from Pylus with a
considerable portion of that fleet which had been engaged in the
capture of Sphakteria, to the island of Korkyra. It has been
already stated that the democratical government at Korkyra had
been suffering severe pressure and privation from the oligarchical
fugitives, who had come back into the island with a body of
barbaric auxiliaries, and established themselves upon Mount Istônê,
not far from the city.<a id="FNanchor_576" href="#Footnote_576"
class="fnanchor">[576]</a> Eurymedon and the Athenians joining
the Korkyræans in the city, attacked and stormed the post on
Mount Istônê; while the vanquished, retiring first to a lofty and
inaccessible peak, were forced to surrender themselves on terms
to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[p. 358]</span> the Athenians.
They abandoned their mercenary auxiliaries altogether, and only
stipulated that they should themselves be sent to Athens, and left
to the discretion of the Athenian people. Eurymedon, assenting to
these terms, deposited the disarmed prisoners in the neighboring
islet of Ptychia, under the distinct condition that, if a single man
tried to escape, the whole capitulation should be null and void.<a
id="FNanchor_577" href="#Footnote_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a></p>

<p>Unfortunately for these prisoners, the orders given to Eurymedon
carried him onward straight to Sicily. It was irksome, therefore, to
him to send away a detachment of his squadron to convey these men to
Athens,—while the honors of delivering them there would be reaped,
not by himself, but by the officer to whom they might be confided:
and the Korkyræans in the city, on their part, were equally anxious
that the prisoners should not be sent to Athens; for their animosity
against them was bitter in the extreme, and they were afraid that the
Athenians might spare their lives, so that their hostility against
the island might be again resumed. And thus a mean jealousy on the
part of Eurymedon, combined with revenge and insecurity on the part
of the victorious Korkyræans, brought about a cruel catastrophe,
paralleled nowhere else in Greece, though too well in keeping with
the previous acts of the bloody drama enacted in this island.</p>

<p>The Korkyræan leaders, seemingly not without the privity of
Eurymedon, sent across to Ptychia fraudulent emissaries under the
guise of friends to the prisoners. These emissaries—assuring the
prisoners that the Athenian commanders, in spite of the convention
signed, were about to hand them over to the Korkyræan people for
destruction—induced some of them to attempt escape in a boat
prepared for the purpose. By concert, the boat was seized in the
act of escaping, so that the terms of the capitulation were really
violated: upon which Eurymedon handed over the prisoners to their
enemies in the island, who imprisoned them all together in one vast
building, under guard of hoplites. From this building they were drawn
out in companies of twenty men each, chained together in couples,
and compelled to march between two lines of hoplites marshalled
on each side of the road.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[p.
359]</span> Those who loitered in the march were hurried on by whips
from behind: as they advanced, their private enemies on both sides
singled them out, striking and piercing them until at length they
miserably perished. Three successive companies were thus destroyed,
ere the remaining prisoners in the interior, who thought merely that
their place of detention was about to be changed, suspected what was
passing: at length they found it out, and one and all then refused
either to quit the building or to permit any one else to enter.
They at the same time piteously implored the intervention of the
Athenians, if it were only to kill them, and thus preserve them from
the cruelties of their merciless countrymen. The latter abstained
from attempts to force the door of the building, but made an aperture
in the roof, from whence they shot down arrows, and poured showers
of tiles, upon the prisoners within; who sought at first to protect
themselves, but at length abandoned themselves to despair, and
assisted with their own hands in the work of destruction. Some of
them pierced their throats with the arrows shot down from the roof:
others hung themselves, either with cords from some bedding which
happened to be in the building, or with strips torn and twisted from
their own garments. Night came on, but the work of destruction,
both from above and within, was continued without intermission,
so that before morning all these wretched men perished, either
by the hands of their enemies or by their own. At daybreak, the
Korkyræans entered the building, piled up the dead bodies on carts,
and transported them out of the city: the exact number we are not
told, but seemingly it cannot have been less than three hundred.
The women who had been taken at Istônê along with these prisoners,
were all sold as slaves.<a id="FNanchor_578" href="#Footnote_578"
class="fnanchor">[578]</a></p>

<p>Thus finished the bloody dissensions in this ill-fated island:
for the oligarchical party were completely annihilated, the
democracy was victorious, and there were no farther violences
throughout the whole war.<a id="FNanchor_579" href="#Footnote_579"
class="fnanchor">[579]</a> It will be recollected that these deadly
feuds began with the return of the oligarchical prisoners from
Corinth, bringing along with them projects both of treason and
of revolution: they ended with the annihilation of that party,
in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[p. 360]</span> the manner
above described; the interval being filled by mutual atrocities and
retaliation, wherein of course the victors had most opportunity
of gratifying their vindictive passions. Eurymedon, after the
termination of these events, proceeded onward with the Athenian
squadron to Sicily: what he did there will be described in a future
chapter devoted to Sicilian affairs exclusively.</p>

<p>The complete prostration of Ambrakia during the campaign of the
preceding year had left Anaktorium without any defence against the
Akarnanians and Athenian squadron from Naupaktus. They besieged and
took it during the course of the present summer;<a id="FNanchor_580"
href="#Footnote_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a> expelling the
Corinthian proprietors, and repeopling the town and its territory
with Akarnanian settlers from all the townships in the country.</p>

<p>Throughout the maritime empire of Athens matters continued
perfectly tranquil, except that the inhabitants of Chios, during
the course of the autumn, incurred the suspicion of the Athenians
from having recently built a new wall to their city, as if it were
done with the intention of taking the first opportunity to revolt.<a
id="FNanchor_581" href="#Footnote_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a>
They solemnly protested their innocence of any such designs, but
the Athenians were not satisfied without exacting the destruction
of the obnoxious wall. The presence on the opposite continent of an
active band of Mitylenæan exiles, who captured both Rhœteium and
Antandrus during the ensuing spring, probably made the Athenians more
anxious and vigilant on the subject of Chios.<a id="FNanchor_582"
href="#Footnote_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a></p>

<p>The Athenian regular tribute-gathering squadron circulated among
the maritime subjects, and captured, during the course of the present
autumn, a prisoner of some importance and singularity. It was a
Persian ambassador, Artaphernes, seized at Eion on the Strymon, in
his way to Sparta with despatches from the Great King. He was brought
to Athens, and his despatches, which were at some length, and written
in the Assyrian character, were translated and made public. The
Great King told the Lacedæmonians, in substance, that he could not
comprehend what they meant; for that among the numerous envoys whom
they had sent, no two told the same story. Accordingly he desired
them, if they wished to make themselves understood, to send some
envoys<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[p. 361]</span> with fresh
and plain instructions to accompany Artaphernes.<a id="FNanchor_583"
href="#Footnote_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a> Such was the
substance of the despatch, conveying a remarkable testimony as to
the march of the Lacedæmonian government in its foreign policy. Had
any similar testimony existed respecting Athens, demonstrating that
her foreign policy was conducted with half as much unsteadiness
and stupidity, ample inferences would have been drawn from it to
the discredit of democracy. But there has been no motive generally
to discredit Lacedæmonian institutions, which included kingship in
double measure,—two parallel lines of hereditary kings: together
with an entire exemption from everything like popular discussion.
The extreme defects in the foreign management of Sparta, revealed by
the despatch of Artaphernes, seem traceable partly to an habitual
faithlessness often noted in the Lacedæmonian character, partly to
the annual change of ephors, so frequently bringing into power men
who strove to undo what had been done by their predecessors, and
still more to the absence of everything like discussion or canvass
of public measures among the citizens. We shall find more than
one example, in the history about to follow, of this disposition
on the part of ephors, not merely to change the policy of their
predecessors, but even to subvert treaties sworn and concluded by
them: and such was the habitual secrecy of Spartan public business,
that in doing this they had neither criticism nor discussion to
fear. Brasidas, when he started from Sparta on the expedition
which will be described in the coming chapter, could not trust the
assurances of the Lacedæmonian executive without binding them by
the most solemn oaths.<a id="FNanchor_584" href="#Footnote_584"
class="fnanchor">[584]</a></p>

<p>The Athenians sent back Artaphernes in a trireme to Ephesus, and
availed themselves of this opportunity for procuring access to the
Great King. They sent envoys along with him, with the intention that
they should accompany him up to Susa: but on reaching Asia, the
news had just arrived that King Artaxerxes<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_362">[p. 362]</span> had recently died. Under such
circumstances, it was not judged expedient to prosecute the mission,
and the Athenians dropped their design.<a id="FNanchor_585"
href="#Footnote_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a></p>

<p>Respecting the great monarchy of Persia, during this long
interval of fifty-four years since the repulse of Xerxes from
Greece, we have little information before us except the names of the
successive kings. In the year 465 <small>B.C.</small>
Xerxes was assassinated by Artabanus and Mithridates, through
one of those plots of great household officers, so frequent in
oriental palaces. He left two sons, or at least two sons present
and conspicuous among a greater number, Darius and Artaxerxes. But
Artabanus persuaded Artaxerxes that Darius had been the murderer
of Xerxes, and thus prevailed upon him to revenge his father’s
death by becoming an accomplice in killing his brother Darius: he
next tried to assassinate Artaxerxes himself, and to appropriate
the crown. Artaxerxes however, apprized beforehand of the scheme,
either slew Artabanus with his own hand or procured him to be slain
and then reigned (known under the name of Artaxerxes Longimanus)
for forty years, down to the period at which we are now arrived.<a
id="FNanchor_586" href="#Footnote_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a></p>

<p>Mention has already been made of the revolt of Egypt from the
dominion of Artaxerxes, under the Libyan prince Inanes, actively
aided by the Athenians. After a few years of success, this revolt
was crushed and Egypt again subjugated, by the energy of the Persian
general Megabyzus, with severe loss to the Athenian forces engaged.
After the peace of Kallias, erroneously called the Kimonian peace,
between the Athenians and the king of Persia, war had not been since
resumed. We read in Ktesias, amidst various anecdotes seemingly
collected at the court of Susa, romantic adventures ascribed to
Megabyzus, his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[p. 363]</span>
wife Amytis, his mother Amestris, and a Greek physician of Kos,
named Apollonides. Zopyrus son of Megabyzus, after the death of
his father, deserted from Persia and came as an exile to Athens.<a
id="FNanchor_587" href="#Footnote_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a></p>

<p>At the death of Artaxerxes Longimanus, the family violences
incident to a Persian succession were again exhibited. His son Xerxes
succeeded him, but was assassinated, after a reign of a few weeks or
months. Another son, Sogdianus, followed, who perished in like manner
after a short interval.<a id="FNanchor_588" href="#Footnote_588"
class="fnanchor">[588]</a> Lastly, a third son, Ochus (known under
the name of Darius Nothus), either abler or more fortunate, kept his
crown and life between nineteen and twenty years. By his queen, the
savage Parysatis, he was father to Artaxerxes Mnemon and Cyrus the
younger, both names of interest in reference to Grecian history, to
whom we shall hereafter recur.</p>

  <h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER LIII.<br />
    EIGHTH YEAR OF THE WAR.</h2>
</div>

<p class="ti0"><span class="smcap">The</span> eighth year of the
war, on which we now touch, presents events of a more important
and decisive character than any of the preceding. In reviewing the
preceding years, we observe that though there is much fighting, with
hardship and privation inflicted on both sides, yet the operations
are mostly of a desultory character, not calculated to determine the
event of the war. But the capture of Sphakteria and its prisoners,
coupled with the surrender of the whole Lacedæmonian fleet, was an
event full of consequences and imposing in the eyes of all Greece.
It stimulated the Athenians to a series of operations, larger and
more ambitious than anything which they had yet conceived;<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[p. 364]</span> directed, not merely
against Sparta in her own country, but also to the reconquest of that
ascendency in Megara and Bœotia which they had lost on or before the
thirty years’ truce. On the other hand, it intimidated so much both
the Lacedæmonians, the revolted Chalkidic allies of Athens in Thrace,
and Perdikkas, king of Macedonia, that between them the expedition
of Brasidas, which struck so serious a blow at the Athenian empire,
was concerted. This year is thus the turning-point of the war. If the
operations of Athens had succeeded, she would have regained nearly as
great a power as she enjoyed before the thirty years’ truce: but it
happened that Sparta, or rather the Spartan Brasidas, was successful,
gaining enough to neutralize all the advantages derived by Athens
from the capture of Sphakteria.</p>

<p>The first enterprise undertaken by the Athenians in the course
of the spring was against the island of Kythêra, on the southern
coast of Laconia. It was inhabited by Lacedæmonian Periœki, and
administered by a governor, and garrison of hoplites, annually sent
thither. It was the usual point of landing for merchantmen from
Libya and Egypt; and as it lay very near to Cape Malea, immediately
over against the gulf of Gythium,—the only accessible portion of the
generally inhospitable coast of Laconia,—the chance that it might
fall into the hands of an enemy was considered as so menacing to
Sparta, that some politicians are said to have wished the island
at the bottom of the sea.<a id="FNanchor_589" href="#Footnote_589"
class="fnanchor">[589]</a> Nikias, in conjunction with Nikostratus
and Autoklês,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[p. 365]</span>
conducted thither a fleet of sixty triremes, with two thousand
Athenian hoplites, some few horsemen, and a body of allies, mainly
Milesians. There were in the island two towns,—Kythêra and Skandeia:
the former having a lower town close to the sea, fronting Cape Malea,
and an upper town on the hill above; the latter, seemingly, on the
south or west coast. Both were attacked at the same time by order
of Nikias; ten triremes and a body of Milesian<a id="FNanchor_590"
href="#Footnote_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a> hoplites disembarked
and captured Skandeia; while the Athenians landed at Kythêra, and
drove the inhabitants out of the lower town into the upper, where
they speedily capitulated. A certain party among them had indeed
secretly invited the coming of Nikias, through which intrigue easy
terms were obtained for the inhabitants. Some few men, indicated
by the Kytherians in intelligence with Nikias, were carried away
as prisoners to Athens: but the remainder were left undisturbed,
and enrolled among the tributary allies under obligation to
pay four talents per annum; an Athenian garrison being placed
at Kythêra for the protection of the island. From hence Nikias
employed seven days in descents and inroads upon the coast, near
Helos, Asinê, Aphrodisia, Kotyrta, and elsewhere. The Lacedæmonian
force was disseminated in petty garrisons,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_366">[p. 366]</span> which remained each for the defence of
its own separate post, without uniting to repel the Athenians, so
that there was only one action, and that of little importance, which
the Athenians deemed worthy of a trophy.</p>

<p>In returning home from Kythêra, Nikias first ravaged the small
strip of cultivated land near Epidaurus Limêra, on the rocky eastern
coast of Laconia, and then attacked the Æginetan settlement at
Thyrea, the frontier strip between Laconia and Argolis. This town
and district had been made over by Sparta to the Æginetans, at the
time when they were expelled from their own island by Athens, in
the first year of the war. The new inhabitants, finding the town
too distant from the sea<a id="FNanchor_591" href="#Footnote_591"
class="fnanchor">[591]</a> for their maritime habits, were now
employed in constructing a fortification close on the shore; in which
work a Lacedæmonian detachment under Tantalus, on guard in that
neighborhood, was assisting them. When the Athenians landed, both
Æginetans and Lacedæmonians at once abandoned the new fortification.
The former, with the commanding officer, Tantalus, occupied the upper
town of Thyrea; but the Lacedæmonian troops, not thinking it tenable,
refused to take part in the defence, and retired to the neighboring
mountains, in spite of urgent entreaty from the Æginetans. The
Athenians, immediately after landing, marched up to the town of
Thyrea, and carried it by storm, burning or destroying everything
within it: all the Æginetans were either killed or made prisoners,
and even Tantalus, disabled by his wounds, became prisoner also. From
hence the armament returned to Athens, where a vote was taken as
to the disposal of the prisoners. The Kytherians brought home were
distributed for safe custody among the dependent islands: Tantalus
was retained along with the prisoners from Sphakteria; but a harder
fate was reserved for the Æginetans; they were<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_367">[p. 367]</span> all put to death, victims to the
long-standing apathy between Athens and Ægina. This cruel act was
nothing more than a strict application of admitted customs of war
in those days: had the Lacedæmonians been the victors, there can
be little doubt that they would have acted with equal rigor.<a
id="FNanchor_592" href="#Footnote_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a></p>

<p>The occupation of Kythêra, in addition to Pylus, by an Athenian
garrison, following so closely upon the capital disaster in
Sphakteria, produced in the minds of the Spartans feelings of alarm
and depression such as they had never before experienced. Within
the course of a few short months their position had completely
changed from superiority and aggression abroad to insult and
insecurity at home. They anticipated nothing less than incessant
foreign attacks on all their weak points, with every probability of
internal defection, from the standing discontent of the Helots: nor
was it unknown to them, probably, that even Kythêra itself had been
lost partly through betrayal. The capture of Sphakteria had caused
peculiar sensations among the Helots, to whom the Lacedæmonians had
addressed both appeals and promises of emancipation, in order to
procure succor for their hoplites while blockaded in the island; and
if the ultimate surrender of these hoplites had abated the terrors
of Lacedæmonian prowess throughout all Greece, this effect had been
produced to a still greater degree among the oppressed Helots. A
refuge at Pylus, and a nucleus which presented some possibility of
expanding into regenerated Messenia, were now before their eyes;
while the establishment of an Athenian garrison at Kythêra opened a
new channel of communication with the enemies of Sparta, so as to
tempt all the Helots of daring temper to stand forward as liberators
of their enslaved race.<a id="FNanchor_593" href="#Footnote_593"
class="fnanchor">[593]</a> The Lacedæmonians, habitually cautious at
all times, felt now as if the tide of fortune had turned decidedly
against them, and acted with confirmed mistrust and dismay, confining
themselves to measures strictly defensive, and organizing a force of
four hundred cavalry, together with a body of bowmen, beyond their
ordinary establishment.</p>

<p>But the precaution which they thought it necessary to take in
regard to the Helots, affords the best measure of their apprehensions
at the moment, and exhibits, indeed, a refinement of fraud<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[p. 368]</span> and cruelty rarely
equalled in history. Wishing to single out from the general body such
as were most high-couraged and valiant, the ephors made proclamation,
that those Helots, who conceived themselves to have earned their
liberty by distinguished services in war, might stand forward to
claim it. A considerable number obeyed the call; probably many who
had undergone imminent hazards during the preceding summer, in order
to convey provisions to the blockaded soldiers in Sphakteria.<a
id="FNanchor_594" href="#Footnote_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a>
They were examined by the government, and two thousand of them
were selected as fully worthy of emancipation; which was forthwith
bestowed upon them in public ceremonial, with garlands, visits
to the temples, and the full measure of religious solemnity. The
government had now made the selection which it desired; presently
every man among these newly-enfranchized Helots was made away
with, no one knew how.<a id="FNanchor_595" href="#Footnote_595"
class="fnanchor">[595]</a> A stratagem at once<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_369">[p. 369]</span> so perfidious in the contrivance, so
murderous in the purpose, and so complete in the execution, stands
without parallel in Grecian history,—we might almost say, without a
parallel in any history. It implies a depravity far greater than the
rigorous execution of a barbarous customary law against prisoners of
war or rebels, even in large numbers. The ephors must have employed
numerous instruments, apart from each other, for the performance of
this bloody deed; yet it appears that no certain knowledge could
be obtained of the details; a striking proof of the mysterious
efficiency of this Council of Five, surpassing even that of the
Council of Ten at Venice, as well as of the utter absence of public
inquiry or discussion.</p>

<p>It was while the Lacedæmonians were in this state of uneasiness
at home, that envoys reached them from Perdikkas of Macedonia
and the Chalkidians of Thrace, entreating aid against Athens;
who was considered likely, in her present tide of success, to
resume aggressive measures against them. There were, moreover,
other parties, in the neighboring cities<a id="FNanchor_596"
href="#Footnote_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a> subject to Athens,
who secretly favored the application, engaging to stand forward in
open revolt as soon as any auxiliary force should arrive to warrant
their incurring the hazard. Perdikkas (who had on his hands a dispute
with his kinsman Arrhibæus, prince of the Lynkestæ-Macedonians,
which he was anxious to be enabled to close successfully) and
the Chalkidians offered at the same time to provide the pay and
maintenance, as well as to facilitate the transit, of the troops
who might be sent to them; and what was of still greater importance
to the success of the enterprise, they specially requested that
Brasidas might be invested with the command.<a id="FNanchor_597"
href="#Footnote_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a> He had now
recovered from his wounds received at Pylus, and his reputation for
adventurous valor, great as it was from positive desert, stood out
still more conspicuously, because not a single other Spartan had
as yet distinguished him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[p.
370]</span>self. His other great qualities, apart from personal
valor, had not yet been shown, for he had never been in any supreme
command. But he burned with impatience to undertake the operation
destined for him by the envoys; although at this time it must have
appeared so replete with difficulty and danger, that probably no
other Spartan except himself would have entered upon it with the
smallest hopes of success. To raise up embarrassments for Athens,
in Thrace, was an object of great consequence to Sparta, while
she also obtained an opportunity of sending away another large
detachment of her dangerous Helots. Seven hundred of these latter
were armed as hoplites and placed under the orders of Brasidas, but
the Lacedæmonians would not assign to him any of their own proper
forces. With the sanction of the Spartan name, with seven hundred
Helot hoplites, and with such other hoplites as he could raise in
Peloponnesus by means of the funds furnished from the Chalkidians,
Brasidas prepared to undertake this expedition, alike adventurous and
important.</p>

<p>Had the Athenians entertained any suspicion of his design, they
could easily have prevented him from ever reaching Thrace. But they
knew nothing of it until he had actually joined Perdikkas, nor did
they anticipate any serious attack from Sparta, in this moment of
her depression, much less an enterprise far bolder than any which
she had ever been known to undertake. They were now elate with hopes
of conquests to come on their own part, their affairs being so
prosperous and promising that parties favorable to their interests
began to revive, both in Megara and in Bœotia; while Hippokratês and
Demosthenês, the two chief stratêgi for the year, were men of energy,
well qualified both to project and execute military achievements.</p>

<p>The first opportunity presented itself in regard to Megara. The
inhabitants of that city had been greater sufferers by the war
than any other persons in Greece: they had been the chief cause
of bringing down the war upon Athens, and the Athenians revenged
upon them all the hardships which they themselves endured from
the Lacedæmonian invasion. Twice in every year they laid waste
the Megarid, which bordered upon their own territory; and that
too with such destructive hands throughout its limited extent,
that they intercepted all subsistence from the lands near the
town, at the same time keeping the harbor<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_371">[p. 371]</span> of Nisæa closely blocked up. Under such
hard conditions the Megarians found much difficulty in supplying even
the primary wants of life.<a id="FNanchor_598" href="#Footnote_598"
class="fnanchor">[598]</a> But their case had now, within the last
few months, become still more intolerable by an intestine commotion
in the city, ending in the expulsion of a powerful body of exiles,
who seized and held possession of Pegæ, the Megarian port in the
gulf of Corinth. Probably imports from Pegæ had been their chief
previous resource against the destruction which came on them from
the side of Athens; so that it became scarcely possible to sustain
themselves, when the exiles in Pegæ not only deprived them of this
resource, but took positive part in harassing them. These exiles
were oligarchical, and the government in Megara had now become more
or less democratical: but the privations in the city presently
reached such a height, that several citizens began to labor for a
compromise, whereby the exiles in Pegæ might be readmitted. It was
evident to the leaders in Megara that the bulk of the citizens could
not long sustain the pressure of enemies from both sides, but it was
also their feeling that the exiles in Pegæ, their bitter political
rivals, were worse enemies than the Athenians, and that the return of
these exiles would be a sentence of death to themselves. To prevent
this counter-revolution, they opened a secret correspondence with
Hippokratês and Demosthenês, engaging to betray both Megara and Nisæa
to the Athenians; though Nisæa, the harbor of Megara, about one mile
from the city, was a separate fortress occupied by a Peloponnesian
garrison, and by them exclusively, as well as the Long Walls, for the
purpose of holding Megara fast to the Lacedæmonian confederacy.<a
id="FNanchor_599" href="#Footnote_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a></p>

<p>The scheme for surprise was concerted, and what is more
remarkable, in the extreme publicity of all Athenian affairs, and
in a matter to which many persons must have been privy, was kept
secret, until the instant of execution. A large Athenian<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[p. 372]</span> force, four thousand
hoplites and six hundred cavalry, was appointed to march at night
by the high road through Eleusis to Megara: but Hippokratês and
Demosthenês themselves went on shipboard from Peiræus to the island
of Minôa, which was close against Nisæa, and had been for some time
under occupation by an Athenian garrison. Here Hippokratês concealed
himself with six hundred hoplites, in a hollow space out of which
brick earth had been dug, on the mainland opposite to Minôa, and not
far from the gate in the Long Wall which opened near the junction
of that wall with the ditch and wall surrounding Nisæa; while
Demosthenês, with some light-armed Platæans and a detachment of
active young Athenians, called Peripoli, and serving as the movable
guard of Attica, in their first or second year of military service,
placed himself in ambush in the sacred precinct of Arês, still closer
to the same gate.</p>

<p>To procure that the gate should be opened, was the task of the
conspirators within. Amidst the shifts to which the Megarians had
been reduced in order to obtain supplies, especially since the
blockade of Minôa, predatory exit by night was not omitted. Some
of these conspirators had been in the habit, before the intrigue
with Athens was projected, of carrying out a small sculler-boat
by night upon a cart, through this gate, by permission of the
Peloponnesian commander of Nisæa and the Long Walls. The boat, when
thus brought out, was carried down to the shore along the hollow
of the dry ditch which surrounded the wall of Nisæa, then put to
sea for some nightly enterprise, and was brought back again along
the ditch before daylight in the morning; the gate being opened,
by permission, to let it in. This was the only way by which any
Megarian vessel could get to sea, since the Athenians at Minôa were
complete masters of the harbor. On the night fixed for the surprise,
this boat was carried out and brought back at the usual hour. But
the moment that the gate in the Long Wall was opened to readmit it,
Demosthenês and his comrades sprang forward to force their way in;
the Megarians along with the boat at the same time setting upon
and killing the guards, in order to facilitate his entrance. This
active and determined band were successful in mastering the gate,
and keeping it open until the six hundred hoplites under Hippokratês
came up, and got into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[p.
373]</span> interior space between the Long Walls. They immediately
mounted the walls on each side, every man as he came in, with
little thought of order, to drive off or destroy the Peloponnesian
guards; who, taken by surprise, and fancying that the Megarians
generally were in concert with the enemy against them,—confirmed,
too, in such belief by hearing the Athenian herald proclaim aloud
that every Megarian who chose might take his post in the line
of Athenian hoplites,<a id="FNanchor_600" href="#Footnote_600"
class="fnanchor">[600]</a>—made at first some resistance, but were
soon discouraged, and fled into Nisæa. By a little after daybreak,
the Athenians found themselves masters of all the line of the Long
Walls, and under the very gates of Megara,—reinforced by the larger
force which, having marched by land through Eleusis, arrived at the
concerted moment.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Megarians within the city were in the greatest
tumult and consternation. But the conspirators, prepared with their
plan, had resolved to propose that the gates should be thrown
open, and that the whole force of the city should be marched out
to fight the Athenians: when once the gates should be open, they
themselves intended to take part with the Athenians, and facilitate
their entrance,—and they had rubbed their bodies over with oil in
order to be visibly distinguished in the eyes of the latter. Their
plan was only frustrated the moment before it was about to be put
in execution, by the divulgation of one of their own comrades.
Their opponents in the city, apprized of what was in contemplation,
hastened to the gate, and intercepted the men rubbed with oil as
they were about to open it. Without betraying any knowledge of the
momentous secret which they had just learned, these opponents loudly
protested against opening the gate and going out to fight an enemy
for whom they had never conceived themselves, even in moments of
greater strength, to be a match in the open field. While insisting
only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[p. 374]</span> on the
public mischiefs of the measure, they at the same time planted
themselves in arms against the gate, and declared that they would
perish before they would allow it to be opened. For this obstinate
resistance the conspirators were not prepared, so that they were
forced to abandon their design and leave the gate closed.</p>

<p>The Athenian generals, who were waiting in expectation that it
would be opened, soon perceived by the delay that their friends
within had been baffled, and immediately resolved to make sure of
Nisæa, which lay behind them; an acquisition important not less in
itself, than as a probable means for the mastery of Megara. They set
about the work with the characteristic rapidity of Athenians. Masons
and tools in abundance were forthwith sent for from Athens, and the
army distributed among themselves the wall of circumvallation round
Nisæa in distinct parts. First, the interior space between the Long
Walls themselves was built across, so as to cut off the communication
with Megara; next, walls were carried out from the outside of both
the Long Walls down to the sea, so as completely to inclose Nisæa,
with its fortifications and ditch. The scattered houses which formed
a sort of ornamented suburb to Nisæa, furnished bricks for this
inclosing circle, or were sometimes even made to form a part of it as
they stood, with the parapets on their roofs; while the trees were
cut down to supply material wherever palisades were suitable. In a
day and a half the work of circumvallation was almost completed,
so that the Peloponnesians in Nisæa saw before them nothing but a
hopeless state of blockade. Deprived of all communication, they not
only fancied that the whole city of Megara had joined the Athenians,
but they were moreover without any supply of provisions, which
had been always furnished to them in daily rations from the city.
Despairing of any speedy relief from Peloponnesus, they accepted easy
terms of capitulation offered to them by the Athenian generals.<a
id="FNanchor_601" href="#Footnote_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a>
After delivering up their arms, each man among them was to be
ransomed for a stipulated price; we are not told how much, but
doubtless a moderate sum. The Lacedæmonian commander, and such other
Lacedæmonians as might be in Nisæa, were, however, required<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[p. 375]</span> to surrender themselves
as prisoners to the Athenians, to be held at their disposal. On
these terms Nisæa was surrendered to the Athenians, who cut off
its communication with Megara, by keeping the intermediate space
between the Long Walls effectively blocked up,—walls, of which
they had themselves, in former days, been the original authors.<a
id="FNanchor_602" href="#Footnote_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a></p>

<p>Such interruption of communication by the Long Walls indicated in
the minds of the Athenian generals a conviction that Megara was now
out of their reach. But the town in its present distracted state,
would certainly have fallen into their hands,<a id="FNanchor_603"
href="#Footnote_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a> had it not been
snatched from them by the accidental neighborhood and energetic
intervention of Brasidas. That officer, occupied in the levy of
troops for his Thracian expedition, was near Corinth and Sikyon, when
he first learned the surprise and capture of the Long Walls. Partly
from the alarm which the news excited among these Peloponnesian
towns, partly from his own personal influence, he got together a
body of two thousand seven hundred Corinthian hoplites, six hundred
Sikyonian and four hundred Phliasian, besides his own small army,
and marched with this united force to Tripodiskus, in the Megarid,
half-way between Megara and Pegæ, on the road over Mount Geraneia;
having first despatched a pressing summons to the Bœotians to request
that they would meet him at that point with reinforcements. He
trusted by a speedy movement to preserve Megara, and perhaps<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[p. 376]</span> even Nisæa; but on
reaching Tripodiskus in the night, he learned that the latter
place had already surrendered. Alarmed for the safety of Megara,
he proceeded thither by a night-march without delay. Taking with
him only a chosen band of three hundred men, he presented himself,
without being expected, at the gates of the city; entreating to be
admitted, and offering to lend his immediate aid for the recovery
of Nisæa. One of the two parties in Megara would have been glad to
comply; but the other, knowing well that in that case the exiles in
Pegæ would be brought back upon them, was prepared for a strenuous
resistance, in which case the Athenian force, still only one
mile off, would have been introduced as auxiliaries. Under these
circumstances the two parties came to a compromise, and mutually
agreed to refuse admittance to Brasidas. They expected that a
battle would take place between him and the Athenians, and each
calculated that Megara would follow the fortunes of the victor.<a
id="FNanchor_604" href="#Footnote_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a></p>

<p>Returning back without success to Tripodiskus, Brasidas was
joined there early in the morning by two thousand Bœotian hoplites
and six hundred cavalry; for the Bœotians had been put in motion
by the same news as himself, and had even commenced their march,
before his messenger arrived, with such celerity as to have
already reached Platæa.<a id="FNanchor_605" href="#Footnote_605"
class="fnanchor">[605]</a> The total force under Brasidas was thus
increased to six thousand hoplites and six hundred cavalry, with
whom he marched straight to the neighborhood of Megara. The Athenian
light troops, dispersed over the plain, were surprised and driven in
by the Bœotian cavalry; but the Athenian cavalry, coming to their
aid, maintained a sharp action with the assailants, wherein, after
some loss on both sides, a slight advantage remained on the side of
the Athenians. They granted a truce for the burial of the Bœotian
officer of cavalry, who was slain with some others. After this
indecisive cavalry skirmish, Brasidas advanced with his main force
into the plain, between Megara and the sea, taking up a position
near to the Athenian hoplites, who were drawn up in battle array,
hard by Nisæa and the Long Walls. He thus offered them battle if
they chose it; but each party expected that the other would attack
and each was unwilling to begin the attack on his own side,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[p. 377]</span> Brasidas was well aware
that, if the Athenians refused to fight, Megara would be preserved
from falling into their hands,—which loss it was his main object to
prevent, and which had in fact been prevented only by his arrival. If
he attacked and was beaten, he would forfeit this advantage,—while,
if victorious, he could hardly hope to gain much more. The Athenian
generals on their side reflected, that they had already secured a
material acquisition in Nisæa, which cut off Megara from their sea;
that the army opposed to them was not only superior in number of
hoplites, but composed of contingents from many different cities, so
that no one city hazarded much in the action; while their own force
was all Athenian, and composed of the best hoplites in Athens, which
would render a defeat severely ruinous to the city: nor did they
think it worth while to encounter this risk, even for the purpose
of gaining possession of Megara. With such views in the leaders on
both sides, the two armies remained for some time in position, each
waiting for the other to attack: at length the Athenians, seeing
that no aggressive movement was contemplated by their opponents,
were the first to retire into Nisæa. Thus left master of the
field, Brasidas retired in triumph to Megara, the gates of which
were now opened without reserve to admit him.<a id="FNanchor_606"
href="#Footnote_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a></p>

<p>The army of Brasidas, having gained the chief point for which
it was collected, speedily dispersed,—he himself resuming his
preparations for Thrace; while the Athenians on their side also
returned home, leaving an adequate garrison for the occupation both
of Nisæa and of the Long Walls. But the interior of Megara underwent
a complete and violent revolution. While the leaders friendly to
Athens, not thinking it safe to remain, fled forthwith and sought
shelter with the Athenians,<a id="FNanchor_607" href="#Footnote_607"
class="fnanchor">[607]</a> the opposite party opened communication
with the exiles at Pegæ and readmitted them into the city; binding
them however, by the most solemn pledges, to observe absolute amnesty
of the past and to study nothing but the welfare of the common
city. The new-comers only kept their pledge during the interval
which elapsed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[p. 378]</span>
until they acquired power to violate it with effect. They soon
got themselves placed in the chief commands of state, and found
means to turn the military force to their own purposes. A review
and examination of arms, of the hoplites in the city, having been
ordered, the Megarian lochi were so marshalled and tutored as to
enable the leaders to single out such victims as they thought
expedient. They seized many of their most obnoxious enemies, some
of them suspected as accomplices in the recent conspiracy with
Athens: the men thus seized were subjected to the forms of a public
trial, before that which was called a public assembly; wherein each
voter, acting under military terror, was constrained to give his
suffrage openly. All were condemned to death and executed, to the
number of one hundred.<a id="FNanchor_608" href="#Footnote_608"
class="fnanchor">[608]</a> The constitution of Megara was then shaped
into an oligarchy of the closest possible kind, a few of the most
violent men taking complete possession of the government. But they
must probably have conducted it with vigor and prudence for their
own purposes, since Thucydidês remarks that it was rare to see a
revolution accomplished by so small a party, and yet so durable.
How long it lasted, he does not mention. A few months after these
incidents, the Megarians regained possession of their Long Walls, by
capture from the Athenians,<a id="FNanchor_609" href="#Footnote_609"
class="fnanchor">[609]</a> to whom indeed they could have been of no
material service, and levelled the whole line of them to the ground:
but the Athenians still retained Nisæa. We may remark, as explaining
in part the durability of this new government, that the truce
concluded at the beginning of the ensuing year must have greatly
lightened the difficulties of any government, whether oligarchical or
democratical, in Megara.</p>

<p>The scheme for surprising Megara had been both laid and executed
with skill, and only miscarried through an accident to which such
schemes are always liable, as well as by the unexpected celerity of
Brasidas. It had, moreover, succeeded so far<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_379">[p. 379]</span> as to enable the Athenians to carry
Nisæa,—one of the posts which they had surrendered by the thirty
years’ truce, and of considerable positive value to them: so
that it counted on the whole as a victory, leaving the generals
with increased encouragement to turn their activity elsewhere.
Accordingly, very soon after the troops had been brought back
from the Megarid,<a id="FNanchor_610" href="#Footnote_610"
class="fnanchor">[610]</a> Hippokratês and Demosthenês concerted a
still more extensive plan for the invasion of Bœotia, in conjunction
with some malcontents in the Bœotian towns, who desired to break
down and democratize the oligarchical governments, and especially
through the agency of a Theban exile named Ptœodôrus. Demosthenês,
with forty triremes, was sent round Peloponnesus to Naupaktus, with
instructions to collect an Akarnanian force, to sail into the inmost
recess of the Corinthian or Krissæan gulf, and to occupy Siphæ, a
maritime town belonging to the Bœotian Thespiæ, where intelligences
had been already established. On the same day, determined beforehand,
Hippokratês engaged to enter Bœotia, with the main force of Athens,
at the southeastern corner of the territory near Tanagra, and to
fortify Delium, the temple of Apollo, on the coast of the Eubœan
strait: while at the same time it was concerted that some Bœotian
and Phocian malcontents should make themselves masters of Chæroneia
on the borders of Phocis. Bœotia would thus be assailed on three
sides at the same moment, so that the forces of the country would be
distracted and unable to coöperate. Internal movements were farther
expected to take place in some of the cities, such as perhaps to
establish democratical governments and place them at once in alliance
with the Athenians.</p>

<p>Accordingly, about the month of August, Demosthenês sailed
from Athens to Naupaktus, where he collected his Akarnanian
allies,—now stronger and more united than ever, since the refractory
inhabitants of Œniadæ had been at length compelled to join their
Akarnanian brethren: moreover, the neighboring Agræans with their
prince Salynthius were also brought into the Athenian alliance. On
the appointed day, seemingly about the beginning of October, he
sailed with a strong force of these allies<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_380">[p. 380]</span> up to Siphæ, in full expectation that
it would be betrayed to him.<a id="FNanchor_611" href="#Footnote_611"
class="fnanchor">[611]</a> But the execution of this enterprise
was less happy than that against Megara. In the first place, there
was a mistake as to the day understood between Hippokratês and
Demosthenês: in the next place, the entire plot was discovered and
betrayed by a Phocian of Phanoteus (bordering on Chæroneia) named
Nicomachus,—communicated first to the Lacedæmonians and through
them to the bœotarchs. Siphæ and Chæroneia were immediately placed
in a state of defence, and Demosthenês, on arriving at the former
place, found not only no party within it favorable to him, but a
formidable Bœotian force which rendered attack unavailing: moreover,
Hippokratês had not yet begun his march, so that the defenders had
nothing to distract their attention from Siphæ.<a id="FNanchor_612"
href="#Footnote_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a> Under these
circumstances, not only was Demosthenês obliged to withdraw without
striking a blow, and to content himself with an unsuccessful
descent upon the territory of Sikyon,<a id="FNanchor_613"
href="#Footnote_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a> but all the expected
internal movements in Bœotia were prevented from breaking out.</p>

<p>It was not till after the Bœotian troops, having repelled the
attack by sea, had retired from Siphæ, that Hippokratês commenced his
march from Athens to invade the Bœotian territory near Tanagra. He
was probably encouraged by false promises from the Bœotian exiles,
otherwise it seems remarkable that he should have persisted in
executing his part of the scheme alone, after the known failure of
the other part. It was, however, executed in a manner which implies
unusual alacrity and confidence. The whole military population of
Athens was marched into Bœotia, to the neighborhood of Delium,
the eastern coast-extremity of the territory belonging to the
Bœotian town of Tanagra; the expedition comprising all classes,
not merely citizens, but also metics or resident non-freemen, and
even non-resident strangers then by accident at Athens. Of course
this statement must be understood with the reserve of ample guards
left behind for the city: but besides the really effective force
of seven thousand hoplites, and several hundred horsemen, there
appear to have been not less than twenty-five thousand light-armed,
half-armed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[p. 381]</span>
or unarmed attendants accompanying the march.<a id="FNanchor_614"
href="#Footnote_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a> The number of
hoplites is here prodigiously great; brought together by general
and indiscriminate proclamation, not selected by a special choice
of the stratêgi out of the names on the muster-roll, as was
usually the case for any distant expedition.<a id="FNanchor_615"
href="#Footnote_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a> As to light-armed,
there was at this time no trained force of that description at
Athens, except a small body of archers. No pains had been taken to
organize either darters or slingers: the hoplites, the horsemen,
and the seamen, constituted the whole effective force of the
city. Indeed, it appears that the Bœotians also were hardly less
destitute than the Athenians of native darters and slingers, since
those which they employed in the subsequent siege of Delium were
in great part hired from the Malian gulf.<a id="FNanchor_616"
href="#Footnote_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a> To employ at one and
the same time heavy-armed and light-armed, was not natural to any
Grecian community, but was a practice which grew up with experience
and necessity. The Athenian feeling, as manifested in the Persæ of
Æschylus a few years after the repulse of Xerxes, proclaims exclusive
pride in the spear and shield, with contempt for the bow: and it was
only during this very year, when alarmed by the Athenian occupation
of Pylus and Kythêra, that the Lacedæmonians, contrary to their
previous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[p. 382]</span> custom,
had begun to organize a regiment of archers.<a id="FNanchor_617"
href="#Footnote_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a> The effective manner
in which Demosthenês had employed the light-armed in Sphakteria
against the Lacedæmonian hoplites, was well calculated to teach an
instructive lesson as to the value of the former description of
troops.</p>

<p>The Bœotian Delium,<a id="FNanchor_618" href="#Footnote_618"
class="fnanchor">[618]</a> which Hippokratês now intended to
occupy and fortify, was a temple of Apollo, strongly situated and
overhanging the sea, about five miles from Tanagra, and somewhat
more than a mile from the border territory of Orôpus,—a territory
originally Bœotian, but at this time dependent on Athens, and even
partly incorporated in the political community of Athens, under the
name of the Deme of Græa.<a id="FNanchor_619" href="#Footnote_619"
class="fnanchor">[619]</a> Orôpus itself was about a day’s march
from Athens, by the road which led through Dekeleia and Sphendalê,
between the mountains Parnês and Phelleus: so that as the distance to
be traversed was so inconsiderable, and the general feeling of the
time was that of confidence, it is probable that men of all ages,
arms, and dispositions crowded to join the march, in part from mere
curiosity and excitement. Hippokratês reached Delium on the day after
he had started from Athens: on the succeeding day he began his work
of fortification, which was completed, all hands aiding, and tools as
well as workmen having been brought along with the army from Athens,
in two days and a half. Having dug a ditch all round the sacred
ground, he threw up the earth in a bank alongside of the ditch,
planting stakes, throwing in fascines, and adding layers of stone
and brick, to keep the work together, and make it into a rampart
of tolerable height and firmness. The vines<a id="FNanchor_620"
href="#Footnote_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a> round the temple,
together with the stakes which served<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_383">[p. 383]</span> as supports to them, were cut to obtain
wood; the houses adjoining furnished bricks and stone: the outer
temple-buildings themselves also, on some of the sides, served as
they stood to facilitate and strengthen the defence; but there was
one side on which the annexed building, once a portico, had fallen
down: and here the Athenians constructed some wooden towers as a
help to the defenders. By the middle of the fifth day after leaving
Athens, the work was so nearly completed, that the army quitted
Delium, and began its march homeward, out of Bœotia; halting, after
it had proceeded about a mile and a quarter, within the Athenian
territory of Orôpus. It was here that the hoplites awaited the
coming of Hippokratês, who still remained at Delium, stationing the
garrison, and giving his final orders about future defence; while
the greater number of the light-armed and unarmed, separating from
the hoplites, and seemingly without any anticipation of the coming
danger, continued their return-march to Athens.<a id="FNanchor_621"
href="#Footnote_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a> Their position
was probably about the western extremity of the plain of Orôpus,
on the verge of the low heights between that plain and Delium.<a
id="FNanchor_622" href="#Footnote_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a></p>

<p>During these five days, however, the forces from all parts
of Bœotia had time to muster at Tanagra: and their number was
just completed as the Athenians were beginning their march<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_384">[p. 384]</span> homeward from Delium.
Contingents had arrived, not only from Thebes and its dependent
townships around, but also from Haliartus, Korôneia, Orchomenus,
Kôpæ, and Thespiæ: that of Tanagra joined on the spot. The government
of the Bœotian confederacy at this time was vested in eleven
bœotarchs,—two chosen from Thebes, the rest in unknown proportion
by the other cities, immediate members of the confederacy,—and in
four senates, or councils, the constitution of which is not known.
Though all the bœotarchs, now assembled at Tanagra, formed a sort
of council of war, yet the supreme command was vested in Pagondas
and Aranthidês, the bœotarchs from Thebes; either in Pagondas
as the senior of the two, or perhaps in both, alternating with
each other day by day.<a id="FNanchor_623" href="#Footnote_623"
class="fnanchor">[623]</a> As the Athenians were evidently in
full retreat, and had already passed the border, all the other
bœotarchs, except Pagondas, were unwilling to hazard a battle<a
id="FNanchor_624" href="#Footnote_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a> on
soil not Bœotian, and were disposed to let them return home without
obstruction. Such reluctance is not surprising, when we reflect that
the chances of defeat were considerable, and that probably some of
these bœotarchs were afraid of the increased power which a victory
would lend to the oppressive tendencies of Thebes. But Pagondas
strenuously opposed this proposition, and carried the soldiers of the
various cities along with him, even in opposition to the sentiments
of their separate leaders, in favor of immediately fighting. He
called them apart and addressed them by separate divisions, in order
that all might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">[p. 385]</span>
not quit their arms at one and the same moment.<a id="FNanchor_625"
href="#Footnote_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a> He characterized
the sentiment of the other bœotarchs as an unworthy manifestation
of weakness, which, when properly considered, had not even the
recommendation of superior prudence. For the Athenians had just
invaded the country, and built a fort for the purpose of continuous
devastation; nor were they less enemies on one side of the border
than on the other. Moreover, they were the most restless and
encroaching of all enemies; and the Bœotians, who had the misfortune
to be their neighbors, could only be secure against them by the most
resolute promptitude in defending themselves, as well as in returning
the blows first given. If they wished to protect their autonomy and
their property against the condition of slavery under which their
neighbors in Eubœa had long suffered, as well as so many other
portions of Greece, their only chance was to march onward and beat
these invaders, following the glorious example of their fathers and
predecessors in the field of Korôneia. The sacrifices were favorable
to an advancing movement, and Apollo, whose temple the Athenians
had desecrated by converting it into a for<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_386">[p. 386]</span>tified place, would lend his cordial
aid to the Bœotian defence.<a id="FNanchor_626" href="#Footnote_626"
class="fnanchor">[626]</a></p>

<p>Finding his exhortations favorably received, Pagondas conducted
the army by a rapid march to a position close to the Athenians.
He was anxious to fight them before they should have retreated
farther; and, moreover, the day was nearly spent,—it was already
late in the afternoon. Having reached a spot where he was only
separated from the Athenians by a hill, which prevented either army
from seeing the other, he marshalled his troops in the array proper
for fighting. The Theban hoplites, with their dependent allies,
ranged in a depth of not less than twenty-five shields, occupied
the right wing: the hoplites of Haliartus, Korôneia, Kôpæ, and its
neighborhood, were in the centre: those of Thespiæ, Tanagra, and
Orchomenus, on the left; for Orchomenus, being the second city
in Bœotia next to Thebes, obtained a second post of honor at the
opposite extremity of the line. Each contingent adopted its own mode
of marshalling the hoplites, and its own depth of files: on this
point there was no uniformity, a remarkable proof of the prevalence
of dissentient custom in Greece, and how much each town, even among
confederates, stood apart as a separate unit.<a id="FNanchor_627"
href="#Footnote_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a> Thucydidês specifies
only the prodigious depth of the Theban hoplites; respecting the
rest, he merely intimates that no common rule was followed. There
is another point also which he does not specify, but which, though
we learn it only on the inferior authority of Diodorus, appears
both true and important. The front ranks of the Theban heavy-armed
were filled by three hundred select warriors, of distinguished
bodily strength, valor, and discipline, who were accustomed to fight
in pairs, each man being attached to his neighbor by a peculiar
tie of intimate friendship. These pairs<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_387">[p. 387]</span> were termed the heniochi and parabatæ,
charioteers and companions; a denomination probably handed down
from the Homeric times, when the foremost heroes really combated
in chariots in front of the common soldiers, but now preserved
after it had outlived its appropriate meaning.<a id="FNanchor_628"
href="#Footnote_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a> This band, composed
of the finest men in the various palæstræ of Thebes, and enjoying a
peculiar training for the defence of the kadmeia, or citadel, was
in after-days detached from the front ranks of the phalanx, and
organized into a separate regiment under the name of the Sacred
Lochus, or Band: we shall see how much it contributed to the
short-lived military ascendency of Thebes. On both flanks of this
mass of Bœotian hoplites, about seven thousand in total number, were
distributed one thousand cavalry, five hundred peltasts, and ten
thousand light-armed or unarmed. The language of the historian seems
to imply that the light-armed on the Bœotian side were something more
effective than the mere multitude who followed the Athenians.</p>

<p>Such was the order in which Pagondas marched his army over
the hill, halting them for a moment in front and sight of the
Athenians, to see that the ranks were even, before he gave the
word for actual charge.<a id="FNanchor_629" href="#Footnote_629"
class="fnanchor">[629]</a> Hippokratês, on his side, apprized<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_388">[p. 388]</span> while still at Delium,
that the Bœotians had moved from Tanagra, first sent orders to his
army to place themselves in battle array, and presently arrived
himself to command them; leaving three hundred cavalry at Delium,
partly as garrison, partly for the purpose of acting on the rear of
the Bœotians during the battle. The Athenian hoplites were ranged
eight deep along the whole line,—with the cavalry, and such of the
light-armed as yet remained, placed on each flank. Hippokratês, after
arriving on the spot, and surveying the ground occupied, marched
along the front of the line briefly encouraging his soldiers; who,
as the battle was just on the Orôpian border, might fancy that
they were not in their own country, and that they were therefore
exposed without necessity. He, too, in a strain similar to that
adopted by Pagondas, reminded the Athenians, that on either side of
the border they were alike fighting for the defence of Attica, to
keep the Bœotians out of it; since the Peloponnesians would never
dare to enter the country without the aid of the Bœotian horse.<a
id="FNanchor_630" href="#Footnote_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a>
He farther called to their recollection the great name of Athens,
and the memorable victory of Myronidês, at Œnophyta, whereby their
fathers had acquired possession of all Bœotia. But he had scarcely
half-finished his progress along the line, when he was forced to
desist by the sound of the Bœotian pæan. Pagondas, after a few
additional sentences of encouragement, had given the word: the
Bœotian hoplites were seen charging down the hill; and the Athenian
hoplites, not less eager, advanced to meet them at a running step.<a
id="FNanchor_631" href="#Footnote_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">[p. 389]</span></p>

<p>At the extremity of the line on each side, the interposition
of ravines prevented the actual meeting of the two armies: but
throughout all the rest of the line, the clash was formidable and the
conduct of both sides resolute. Both armies, maintaining their ranks
compact and unbroken, came to the closest quarters; to the contact
and pushing of shields against each other.<a id="FNanchor_632"
href="#Footnote_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a> On the left half
of the Bœotian line, consisting of hoplites from Thespiæ, Tanagra,
and Orchomenus, the Athenians were victorious. The Thespians, who
resisted longest, even after their comrades had given way, were
surrounded and sustained the most severe loss from the Athenians;
who in the ardor of success, while wheeling round to encircle the
enemy, became disordered and came into conflict even with their own
citizens, not recognizing them at the moment: some loss of life was
the consequence.</p>

<p>While the left of the Bœotian line was thus worsted and driven
back for protection to the right, the Thebans on that side gained
decided advantage. Though the resolution and discipline of the
Athenians was noway inferior, yet as soon as the action came
to close quarters and to propulsion with shield and spear, the
prodigious depth of the Theban column (more than triple of the
depth of the Athenians, twenty-five against eight) enabled them to
bear down their enemies by mere superiority of weight and mass.
Moreover, the Thebans appear to have been superior to the Athenians
in gymnastic training and acquired bodily force, as they were
inferior both in speech and in intelligence. The chosen Theban
warriors in the front rank were especially superior: but apart
from such superiority, if we assume simple equality of individual
strength and resolution on both sides,<a id="FNanchor_633"
href="#Footnote_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a> it is plain that
when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">[p. 390]</span> the two
opposing columns came into conflict, shield against shield, the
comparative force of forward pressure would decide the victory.
This motive is sufficient to explain the extraordinary depth of the
Theban column, which was increased by Epameinondas, half a century
afterwards, at the battle of Leuktra, from a depth of twenty-five men
to the still more astonishing depth of fifty: nor need we suspect the
correctness of the text, with some critics, or suppose, with others,
that the great depth of the Theban files arose from the circumstance
that the rear ranks were too poor to provide themselves with armor.<a
id="FNanchor_634" href="#Footnote_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a>
Even in a depth of eight, which was that of the Athenian column in
the present engagement,<a id="FNanchor_635" href="#Footnote_635"
class="fnanchor">[635]</a> and seemingly the usual depth in a battle,
the spears of the four rear ranks could hardly have protruded
sufficiently beyond the first line to do any mischief. The great use
of all the ranks behind the first four, was partly to take the place
of such of the foremost lines as might be slain, partly, to push
forward the lines before them from behind. The greater the depth of
the files, the more irresistible did this propelling force become:
hence the Thebans at Delium, as well as at Leuktra, found their
account in deepening the column to so remarkable a degree, to which
we may fairly presume that their hoplites were trained beforehand.</p>

<p>The Thebans on the right thus pushed back<a id="FNanchor_636"
href="#Footnote_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a> the troops on the
left of the Athenian line, who retired at first slowly, and for a
short space, maintaining their order unbroken, so that the victory of
the Athenians on their own right would have restored the battle, had
not Pagondas detached from the rear two squad<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_391">[p. 391]</span>rons of cavalry; who, wheeling unseen
round the hill behind, suddenly appeared to the relief of the Bœotian
left, and produced upon the Athenians on that side, already deranged
in their ranks by the ardor of pursuit, the intimidating effect of
a fresh army arriving to reinforce the Bœotians. And thus, even on
the right, the victorious portion of their line, the Athenians lost
courage and gave way; while on the left, where they were worsted
from the beginning, they found themselves pressed harder and harder
by the pursuing Thebans: so that in the end, the whole Athenian army
was broken, dispersed, and fled. The garrison of Delium, reinforced
by three hundred cavalry, whom Hippokratês had left there to assail
the rear of the Bœotians during the action, either made no vigorous
movement, or were repelled by a Bœotian reserve stationed to watch
them. Flight having become general among the Athenians, the different
parts of their army took different directions: the right sought
refuge at Delium, the centre fled to Orôpus, and the left took a
direction towards the high lands of Parnês. The pursuit of the
Bœotians was vigorous and destructive: they had an efficient cavalry,
strengthened by some Lokrian horse who had arrived even during the
action: their peltasts also, and their light-armed, would render
valuable service against retreating hoplites.<a id="FNanchor_637"
href="#Footnote_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a> Fortunately for the
vanquished, the battle had begun very late in the afternoon, leaving
no long period of daylight: this important circumstance saved the
Athenian army from almost total destruction.<a id="FNanchor_638"
href="#Footnote_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a> As it was, however,
the general Hippokratês, together with nearly one thousand hoplites,
and a considerable number of light-armed and attendants, were
slain; while the loss of the Bœotians, chiefly on their defeated
left wing, was rather under five hundred hoplites. Some prisoners<a
id="FNanchor_639" href="#Footnote_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a>
seem to have been made, but we hear little about them. Those who had
fled to Delium and Orôpus were conveyed back by sea to Athens.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">[p. 392]</span></p>

<p>The victors retired to Tanagra, after erecting their trophy,
burying their own dead, and despoiling those of their enemies. An
abundant booty of arms from the stripped warriors, long remained
to decorate the temples of Thebes, and the spoil in other ways is
said to have been considerable. Pagondas also resolved to lay siege
to the newly-established fortress at Delium: but before commencing
operations,—which might perhaps prove tedious, since the Athenians
could always reinforce the garrison by sea,—he tried another means of
attaining the same object. He despatched to the Athenians a herald,
who, happening in his way to meet the Athenian herald, coming to ask
the ordinary permission for burial of the slain, warned him that no
such request would be entertained until the message of the Bœotian
general had first been communicated, and thus induced him to come
back to the Athenian commanders. The Bœotian herald was instructed
to remonstrate against the violation of holy custom committed by the
Athenians in seizing and fortifying the temple of Delium; wherein
their garrison was now dwelling, performing numerous functions
which religion forbade to be done in a sacred place, and using as
their common drink the water especially consecrated to sacrificial
purposes. The Bœotians therefore solemnly summoned them in the name
of Apollo, and the gods inmates along with him, to evacuate the
place, carrying away all that belonged to them: and the herald gave
it to be understood, that, unless this summons were complied with, no
permission would be granted to bury the dead.</p>

<p>Answer was returned by the Athenian herald, who now went to
the Bœotian commanders, to the following effect: “The Athenians
did not admit that they had hitherto been guilty of any wrong in
reference to the temple, and protested that they would persist in
respecting it for the future as much as possible. Their object in
taking possession of it had been no evil sentiment towards the holy
place, but the necessity of avenging the repeated invasions of Attica
by the Bœotians. Possession of the territory, according to the
received maxims of Greece, always carried along with it possession of
temples therein situated, under obligation to fulfil all customary
obligations to the resident god, as far as circumstances permitted.
It was upon this maxim that the Bœotians had themselves acted when
they took possession of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">[p.
393]</span> their present territory, expelling the prior occupants
and appropriating the temples: it was upon the same maxim that
the Athenians would act in retaining so much of Bœotia as they
had now conquered, and in conquering more of it, if they could.
Necessity compelled them to use the consecrated water—a necessity
not originating in the ambition of Athens, but in prior Bœotian
aggressions upon Attica,—a necessity which they trusted that the
gods would pardon, since their altars were allowed as a protection
to the involuntary offender, and none but he who sinned without
constraint experienced their displeasure. The Bœotians were guilty
of far greater impiety in refusing to give back the dead, except
upon certain conditions connected with the holy ground, than the
Athenians, who merely refused to turn the duty of sepulture into an
unseemly bargain. Tell us unconditionally (concluded the Athenian
herald) that we may bury our dead under truce, pursuant to the maxims
of our forefathers. Do not tell us that we may do so on condition of
going out of Bœotia, for we are no longer in Bœotia; we are in our
own territory, won by the sword.”</p>

<p>The Bœotian generals dismissed the herald with a reply short and
decisive: “If you are in Bœotia, you may take away all that belongs
to you, but only on condition of going out of it. If on the other
hand you are in your own territory, you can take your own resolution
without asking us.”<a id="FNanchor_640" href="#Footnote_640"
class="fnanchor">[640]</a></p>

<p>In this debate, curious as an illustration of Grecian manners
and feelings, there seems to have been special pleading and evasion
on both sides. The final sentence of the Bœotians was good as a
reply to the incidental argument raised by the Athenian herald,
who had rested the defence of Athens in regard to the temple of
Delium on the allegation that the territory was Athenian, not
Bœotian, Athenian by conquest and by the right of the strongest,
and had concluded by affirming the same thing about Oropia, the
district to which the battle-field belonged. It was only this same
argument, of actual superior force, which the Bœotians retorted,
when they said: “If the territory to which your application refers
is yours by right of conquest (<i>i. e.</i> if you are <i>de facto</i> masters
of it, and are strongest within it), you can of course<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_394">[p. 394]</span> do what you think best
in it: you need not ask any truce at our hands; you can bury your
dead without a truce.”<a id="FNanchor_641" href="#Footnote_641"
class="fnanchor">[641]</a> The Bœotians knew that at this moment the
field of battle was under guard by a detachment of their army,<a
id="FNanchor_642" href="#Footnote_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a>
and that the Athenians could not obtain the dead bodies without
permission; but since the Athenian herald had asserted the reverse
as a matter of fact, we can hardly wonder that they resented the
production of such an argument; meeting it by a reply sufficiently
pertinent in mere diplomatic fencing.</p>

<p>But if the Athenian herald, instead of raising the incidental
point of territorial property, combined with an incautious definition
of that which constituted territorial property, as a defence against
the alleged desecration of the temple of Delium, had confined himself
to the main issue, he would have put the Bœotians completely in the
wrong. According to principles universally respected in Greece, the
victor, if solicited, was held bound to grant to the vanquished
a truce for burying his dead; to grant and permit it absolutely,
without annexing any conditions. On this, the main point in debate,
the Bœotians sinned against the most sacred international law of
Greece, when they exacted the evacuation of the temple at Delium
as a condition for consenting to permit the burial of the Athenian
dead. Ultimately, after they had taken Delium, we shall find that
they did grant it unconditionally; and we may doubt whether they
would have ever persisted in refusing it, if the Athenian herald had
pressed this one important principle separately and exclusively;
and if he had not, by an unskilful plea in vindication of the right
to occupy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">[p. 395]</span> and
live at Delium, both exasperated their feelings, and furnished them
with a collateral issue as a means of evading the main demand.<a
id="FNanchor_643" href="#Footnote_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a></p>

<p>To judge this curious debate with perfect impartiality, we ought
to add, in reference to the conduct of the Athenians in occupying
Delium, that for an enemy to make special choice of a temple, as
a post to be fortified and occupied, was a proceeding certainly
rare, perhaps hardly admissible, in Grecian warfare. Nor does the
vindication offered by the Athenian herald meet the real charge
preferred. It is one thing for an enemy of superior force to overrun
a country, and to appropriate everything within it, sacred as well
as profane: it is another thing for a border enemy, not yet in
sufficient force for conquering the whole, to convert a temple of
convenient site into a regular garrisoned fortress, and make it
a base of operations against the neighboring population. On this
ground, the Bœotians might reasonably complain of the seizure
of Delium: though I apprehend that no impartial interpreter of
Grecian international custom would have thought them warranted in
attaching it as a condition to their grant of the burial-truce when
solicited.</p>

<p>All negotiation being thus broken off, the Bœotian generals
prepared to lay siege to Delium, aided by two thousand Corinthian
hoplites, together with some Megarians and the late Peloponnesian
garrison of Nisæa, who joined after the news of the battle. Though
they sent for darters and slingers, probably Œtæans and Ætolians,
from the Maliac gulf, yet their direct attacks were at first all
repelled by the garrison, aided by an Athenian squadron off the
coast, in spite of the hasty and awkward defences by which alone the
fort was protected. At length<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">[p.
396]</span> they contrived a singular piece of fire-mechanism, which
enabled them to master the place. They first sawed in twain a thick
beam, pierced a channel through it long-ways from end to end, coated
most part of the channel with iron, and then joined the two halves
accurately together. From the farther end of this hollowed beam they
suspended by chains a boiler, full of pitch, brimstone, and burning
charcoal; lastly, an iron tube projected from the end of the interior
channel of the beam, in a direction so as to come near to the boiler.
Such was the machine, which, constructed at some distance, was
brought on carts and placed close to the wall, near the palisading
and the wooden towers. The Bœotians then applied great bellows to
their own end of the beam, blowing violently with a close current
of air through the interior channel, so as to raise an intense fire
in the boiler at the other end. The wooden portions of the wall,
soon catching fire, became untenable for the defenders, who escaped
in the best way they could, without attempting farther resistance.
Two hundred of them were made prisoners and a few slain; but the
greater number got safely on shipboard. This recapture of Delium
took place on the seventeenth day after the battle, during all which
interval the Athenians slain had remained on the field unburied.
Presently, however, arrived the Athenian herald to make fresh
application for the burial-truce; which was now forthwith granted,
and granted unconditionally.<a id="FNanchor_644" href="#Footnote_644"
class="fnanchor">[644]</a></p>

<p>Such was the memorable expedition and battle of Delium, a fatal
discouragement to the feeling of confidence and hope which had
previously reigned at Athens, besides the painful immediate loss
which it inflicted on the city. Among the hoplites who took part in
the vigorous charge and pushing of shields, the philosopher Sokratês
is to be numbered. His bravery both in the battle and the retreat was
much extolled by his friends, and doubtless with good reason: he had
before served with credit in the ranks of the hoplites at Potidæa,
and he served also at Amphipolis: his patience under hardship and
endurance of heat and cold being not less remarkable than his
personal bravery. He and his friend Lachês were among those hoplites,
who, in the retreat from Delium, instead of flinging away their
arms and taking to flight,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">[p.
397]</span> kept their ranks, their arms, and their firmness of
countenance; insomuch that the pursuing cavalry found it dangerous
to meddle with them, and turned to an easier prey in the disarmed
fugitives. Alkibiadês also served at Delium in the cavalry, and
helped to protect Sokratês in the retreat. The latter was thus
exposing his life at Delium nearly at the same time when Aristophanês
was exposing him to derision in the comedy of the Clouds, as
a dreamer alike morally worthless and physically incapable.<a
id="FNanchor_645" href="#Footnote_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a></p>

<p>Severe as the blow was which the Athenians suffered at Delium,
their disasters in Thrace about the same time, or towards the close
of the same summer and autumn, were yet more calamitous. I have
already mentioned the circumstances which led to the preparation of a
Lacedæmonian force intended to act against the Athenians in Thrace,
under Brasidas, in concert with the Chalkidians, revolted subjects of
Athens, and with Perdikkas of Macedon. Having frustrated the Athenian
designs against Megara (as described above),<a id="FNanchor_646"
href="#Footnote_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a> Brasidas completed
the levy of his division,—seventeen hundred hoplites, partly Helots,
partly Dorian Peloponnesians,—and conducted them, towards the close
of the summer, to the Lacedæmonian colony of Herakleia, in the
Trachinian territory near the Maliac gulf. To reach Macedonia and
Thrace, it was necessary for him to pass through Thessaly, which was
no easy task; for the war had now lasted so long that every state in
Greece had become mistrustful of the transit of armed foreigners.
Moreover, the mass of the Thessalian population were decidedly
friendly to Athens, nor had he any sufficient means to force a
passage: while, should he wait to apply for formal permission,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_398">[p. 398]</span> there was much doubt
whether it would be granted, and perfect certainty of such delay
and publicity as would put the Athenians on their guard. But though
such was the temper of the Thessalian people, yet the Thessalian
governments, all oligarchical, sympathized with Lacedæmon; and the
federal authority or power of the tagus, which bound together the
separate cities, was generally very weak. What was of still greater
importance, the Macedonian Perdikkas, as well as the Chalkidians, had
in every city powerful guests and partisans, whom they prevailed upon
to exert themselves actively in forwarding the passage of the army.<a
id="FNanchor_647" href="#Footnote_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a></p>

<p>To these men Brasidas sent a message at Pharsalus, as soon as he
reached Herakleia; and Nikonidas, of Larissa, with other Thessalian
friends of Perdikkas, assembling at Melitæa, in Achaia Phthiôtis,
undertook to escort him through Thessaly. By their countenance
and support, combined with his own boldness, dexterity, and rapid
movements, he was enabled to accomplish the seemingly impossible
enterprise of running through the country, not only without the
consent but against the feeling of its inhabitants, simply by
such celerity as to forestall opposition. After traversing Achaia
Phthiôtis, a territory dependent on the Thessalians, Brasidas
began his march from Melitæa through Thessaly itself, along with
his powerful native guides. Notwithstanding all possible secrecy
and celerity, his march became so far divulged, that a body of
volunteers from the neighborhood, offended at the proceeding, and
unfriendly to Nikonidas, assembled to oppose his progress down the
valley of the river Enipeus. Reproaching him with wrongful violation
of an independent territory, by the introduction of armed forces
without permission from the general government, they forbade him to
proceed farther. His only chance of making progress lay in disarming
their opposition by fair words. His guides excused themselves by
saying that the suddenness of his arrival had imposed upon them
as his guests the obligation of conducting him through, without
waiting to ask for formal permission: to offend their countrymen,
however, was the farthest thing from their thoughts and they would
renounce the enterprise if the persons now assembled persisted in
their requisition. The same conciliatory<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_399">[p. 399]</span> tone was adopted by Brasidas himself.
“He protested his strong feeling of respect and friendship for
Thessaly and its inhabitants: his arms were directed against the
Athenians, not against them: nor was he aware of any unfriendly
relation subsisting between the Thessalians and Lacedæmonians,
such as to exclude either of them from the territory of the other.
Against the prohibition of the parties now before him, he could
not possibly march forward, nor would he think of attempting it;
but he put it to their good feeling whether they ought to prohibit
him.” Such conciliatory language was successful in softening the
opponents and inducing them to disperse. But so afraid were his
guides of renewed opposition in other parts, that they hurried him
forward still more rapidly,<a id="FNanchor_648" href="#Footnote_648"
class="fnanchor">[648]</a> and he “passed through the country at a
running pace without halting.” Leaving Melitæa in the morning, he
reached Pharsalus on the same night, encamping on the river Apidanus:
thence he proceeded on the next day to Phakium, and on the day
afterwards into Perrhæbia,<a id="FNanchor_649" href="#Footnote_649"
class="fnanchor">[649]</a> a territory adjoining to and dependent
on Thessaly, under the mountain range of Olympus. Here he was in
safety, so that his Thessalian guides left him; while the Perrhæbians
conducted him over the pass of Olympus—the same over which the army
of Xerxes had marched—to Dium, in Macedonia, in the territory of
Perdikkas, on the northern edge of the mountain.<a id="FNanchor_650"
href="#Footnote_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">[p. 400]</span></p>

<p>The Athenians were soon apprized of this stolen passage, so ably
and rapidly executed, in a manner which few other Greeks, certainly
no other Lacedæmonian, would have conceived to be possible. Aware
of the new enemy thus brought within reach of their possessions
in Thrace, they transmitted orders thither for greater vigilance,
and at the same time declared open war against Perdikkas;<a
id="FNanchor_651" href="#Footnote_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a> but
unfortunately without sending any efficient force, at the moment when
timely defensive intervention was imperiously required. Perdikkas
immediately invited Brasidas to join him in the attack of Arrhibæus,
prince of the Macedonians, called Lynkestæ, or of Lynkus; a summons
which the Spartan could not decline, since Perdikkas provided half
of the pay and maintenance of the army,—but which he obeyed with
reluctance, anxious as he was to commence operations against the
allies of Athens. Such reluctance was still farther strengthened by
envoys from the Chalkidians of Thrace, who, as zealous enemies of
Athens, joined him forthwith, but discouraged any vigorous efforts
to relieve Perdikkas from embarrassing enemies in the interior,
in order that the latter might be under more pressing motives to
conciliate and assist them. Accordingly Brasidas, though he joined
Perdikkas, and marched along with the Macedonian army towards the
territory of the Lynkestæ, was not only averse to active military
operations, but even entertained with favor propositions from
Arrhibæus, wherein the latter expressed his wish to become the ally
of Lacedæmon, and offered to refer all his differences with Perdikkas
to the arbitration of the Spartan general himself. Communicating
these propositions to Perdikkas, Brasidas invited him to listen to
an equitable compromise, admitting Arrhibæus into the alliance of
Lacedæmon. But Perdikkas indignantly refused: “He had not called
in Brasidas as a judge, to decide disputes between him and his
enemies, but as an auxiliary, to put them down wherever he might
point them out: and he protested against the iniquity of Brasidas in
entering into terms with Arrhibæus, while the Lacedæmonian army was
half paid and maintained by him,” (Perdikkas.<a id="FNanchor_652"
href="#Footnote_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a>) Notwithstanding
such remonstrances, and even a hostile protest, Brasidas persisted
in his intended conference with Arrhi<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_401">[p. 401]</span>bæus, and was so far satisfied with
the propositions made that he withdrew his troops without marching
over the pass into Lynkus. Too feeble to act alone, Perdikkas
loudly complained, and contracted his allowance for the future so
as to provide for only one-third of the army of Brasidas instead of
one-half.</p>

<p>To this inconvenience, however, Brasidas submitted, in haste to
begin his march into Chalkidikê, and his operations jointly with
the Chalkidians, for seducing or subduing the subject-allies of
Athens. His first operation was against Akanthus, on the isthmus
of the peninsula of Athos, the territory of which he invaded a
little before the vintage, probably about the middle of September;
when the grapes were ripe, but still out, and the whole crop of
course exposed to ruin at the hands of an enemy superior in force:
so important was it to Brasidas to have escaped the necessity of
wasting another month in conquering the Lynkestæ. There was within
the town of Akanthus a party in concert with the Chalkidians,
anxious to admit him, and to revolt openly from Athens. But the
mass of the citizens were averse to this step: and it was only by
dwelling on the terrible loss from exposure of the crop without,
that the anti-Athenian party could persuade them even to grant the
request of Brasidas to be admitted singly,<a id="FNanchor_653"
href="#Footnote_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a> so as to explain his
purposes formally before the public assembly, which would take its
own decision afterwards. “For a Lacedæmonian (says Thucydidês) he
was no mean speaker:” and if he is to have credit for that which we
find written in Thucydidês, such an epithet would be less than his
desert. Doubtless, however, the substance of the speech is genuine:
and it is one of the most interesting in Grecian history; partly
as a manifesto of professed Lacedæmonian policy, partly because
it had a great practical effect in determining, on an occasion of
paramount importance, a multitude which, though unfavorably inclined
to him, was not beyond the reach of argu<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_402">[p. 402]</span>ment. I give the chief points of the
speech, without binding myself to the words.</p>

<p>“Myself and my soldiers have been sent, Akanthians, to realize
the purpose which we proclaimed on beginning the war; that we took
arms to liberate Greece from the Athenians. Let no man blame us for
having been long in coming, or for the mistake which we made at the
outset in supposing that we should quickly put down the Athenians by
operations against Attica, without exposing you to any risk. Enough,
that we are now here on the first opportunity, resolved to put them
down if you will lend us your aid. To find myself shut out of your
town, nay, to find that I am not heartily welcomed, astonishes me.
We, Lacedæmonians, undertook this long and perilous march, in the
belief that we were coming to friends eagerly expecting us; and
it would indeed be terrible if you should now disappoint us, and
stand out against your own freedom as well as that of other Greeks.
Your example, standing high as you do both for prudence and power,
will fatally keep back other Greeks, and make them suspect that I
am wanting either in power to protect them against Athens, or in
honest purpose. Now, in regard to power, my own present army was
one which the Athenians, though superior in number, were afraid to
fight near Nisæa; nor are they at all likely to send an equal force
hither against me by sea. And in regard to my purpose, it is not
one of mischief, but of liberation, the Lacedæmonian authorities
having pledged themselves to me by the most solemn oaths, that every
city which joins me shall retain its autonomy. You have therefore
the best assurance both as to my purposes and as to my power; still
less need you apprehend that I am come with factious designs, to
serve the views of any particular men among you, and to remodel your
established constitution to the disadvantage either of the many or
of the few. That would be worse than foreign subjugation, so that
we Lacedæmonians should be taking all this trouble to earn hatred
instead of gratitude. We should play the part of unworthy traitors,
worse even than that high-handed oppression of which we accuse the
Athenians: we should at once violate our oaths and sin against our
strongest political interests. Perhaps you may say, that though you
wish me well, you desire for your parts to be let alone, and to
stand aloof from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">[p. 403]</span>
a dangerous struggle. You will tell me to carry my propositions
elsewhere, to those who can safely embrace them, but not to thrust
my alliance upon any people against their own will. If this should
be your language, I shall first call your local gods and heroes to
witness that I have come to you with a mission of good, and have
employed persuasion in vain; I shall then proceed to ravage your
territory and extort your consent, thinking myself justly entitled
to do so, on two grounds. First, that the Lacedæmonians may not
sustain actual damage from these good wishes which you profess
towards me without actually joining,—damage in the shape of that
tribute which you annually send to Athens. Next, that the Greeks
generally may not be prevented by you from becoming free. It is only
on the ground of common good, that we Lacedæmonians can justify
ourselves for liberating any city against its own will; but as we
are conscious of desiring only extinction of the empire of others,
not acquisition of empire for ourselves, we should fail in our duty
if we suffered you to obstruct that liberation which we are now
carrying to all. Consider well my words, then: take to yourselves
the glory of beginning the era of emancipation for Greece, save your
own properties from damage, and attach an ever-honorable name to the
community of Akanthus.”<a id="FNanchor_654" href="#Footnote_654"
class="fnanchor">[654]</a></p>

<p>Nothing could be more plausible or judicious than this language
of Brasidas to the Akanthians, nor had they any means of detecting
the falsity of the assertion, which he afterwards repeated in
other places besides,<a id="FNanchor_655" href="#Footnote_655"
class="fnanchor">[655]</a> that he had braved the forces of
Athens at Nisæa with the same army as that now on the outside
of the walls. Perhaps the simplicity of his speech and manner
may even have lent strength to his assurances. As soon as he
had retired, the subject was largely discussed in the assembly,
with much difference of opinion among the speakers, and perfect
freedom on both sides: and the decision, not called for until
after a long debate, was determined partly by the fair promises
of Brasidas, partly by the certain loss which the ruin of the
vine-crop would entail. The votes of the citizens present being
taken secretly, a majority resolved to accede to the proposi<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_404">[p. 404]</span>tions of Brasidas
and revolt from Athens.<a id="FNanchor_656" href="#Footnote_656"
class="fnanchor">[656]</a> Exacting the renewal of his pledge and
that of the Lacedæmonian authorities, for the preservation of full
autonomy to every city which should join him, they received his army
into the town. The neighboring city of Stageirus, a colony of Andros,
as Akanthus also was, soon followed the example.<a id="FNanchor_657"
href="#Footnote_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a></p>

<p>There are few acts in history wherein Grecian political reason
and morality appear to greater advantage than in this proceeding of
the Akanthians. The habit of fair, free, and pacific discussion;
the established respect to the vote of the majority; the care to
protect individual independence of judgment by secret suffrage; the
deliberate estimate of reasons on both sides by each individual
citizen, all these main laws and conditions of healthy political
action appear as a part of the confirmed character of the Akanthians.
We shall not find Brasidas entering other towns in a way so
creditable or so harmonious.</p>

<p>But there is another inference which the scene just described
irresistibly suggests. It affords the clearest proof that the
Akanthians had little to complain of as subject-allies of Athens, and
that they would have continued in that capacity, if left to their
own choice, without the fear of having their crop destroyed. Such is
the pronounced feeling of the mass of the citizens: the party who
desire otherwise are in a decided minority. It is only the combined
effect of severe impending loss, and of tempting assurances held out
by the worthiest representative whom Sparta ever sent out, which
induces them to revolt from Athens: nor even then is the resolution
taken without long opposition, and a large dissentient minority, in
a case where secret suffrage insured free and genuine expression
of preference from every individual. Now, it is impossible that
the scene in Akanthus at this critical moment could have been of
such a character, had the empire of Athens been practically odious
and burdensome to the subject-allies, as it is commonly depicted.
Had such been the fact; had the Akanthians felt that the imperial
ascendency of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">[p. 405]</span>
Athens oppressed them with hardship or humiliation, from which their
neighbors, the revolted Chalkidians in Olynthus and elsewhere, were
exempt, they would have hailed the advent of Brasidas with that
cordiality which he himself expected and was surprised not to find.
The sense of present grievance, always acute and often excessive,
would have stood out as their prominent impulse: nor would they have
needed either intimidation or cajolery to induce them to throw open
their gates to the liberator, who, in his speech within the town,
finds no actual suffering to appeal to, but is obliged to gain over
an audience evidently unwilling by alternate threats and promises.</p>

<p>As in Akanthus, so in most of the other Thracian subjects of
Athens, the bulk of the citizens, though strongly solicited by
the Chalkidians, manifest no spontaneous disposition to revolt
from Athens. We shall find the party who introduce Brasidas to be
a conspiring minority, who not only do not consult the majority
beforehand, but act in such a manner as to leave no free option to
the majority afterwards, whether they will ratify or reject: bring in
a foreign force to overawe them and compromise them without their own
consent in hostility against Athens. Now that which makes the events
of Akanthus so important as an evidence, is, that the majority is not
thus entrapped and compressed, but pronounces its judgment freely
after ample discussion: the grounds of that judgment are clearly set
forth to us, so as to show that hatred of Athens, if even it exists
at all, is in no way a strong or determining feeling. Had there
existed any such strong feeling among the subject-allies of Athens in
the Chalkidic peninsula, there was no Athenian force now present to
hinder them all from opening their gates to the liberator Brasidas
by spontaneous majorities, as he himself, encouraged by the sanguine
promises of the Chalkidians, evidently expected that they would do.
But nothing of this kind happened.</p>

<p>That which I before remarked in recounting the revolt of Mitylênê,
a privileged ally of Athens, is now confirmed in the revolt of
Akanthus, a tributary and subject-ally. The circumstances of both
prove that imperial Athens inspired no hatred, and occasioned no
painful grievance, to the population of her subject-cities generally:
the movements against her arose from party-minorities, of the same
character as that Platæan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">[p.
406]</span> party which introduced the Theban assailants into Platæa
at the commencement of the Peloponnesian war. There are of course
differences of sentiment between one town and another; but the
conduct of the towns generally demonstrates that the Athenian empire
was not felt by them to be a scheme of plunder and oppression, as
Mr. Mitford and others would have us believe. It is indeed true that
Athens managed her empire with reference to her own feelings and
interests, and that her hold was rather upon the prudence than upon
the affection of her allies, except in so far as those among them
who were democratically governed sympathized with her democracy:
it is also true that restrictions in any form on the autonomy of
each separate city were offensive to the political instincts of the
Greeks: moreover, Athens took less and less pains to disguise or
soften the real character of her empire, as one resting simply on
established fact and superior force. But this is a different thing
from the endurance of practical hardship and oppression, which,
had it been real, would have inspired strong positive hatred among
the subject-allies, such as Brasidas expected to find universal in
Thrace, but did not really find, in spite of the easy opening which
his presence afforded.</p>

<p>The acquisition of Akanthus and Stageirus enabled Brasidas in no
very long time to extend his conquests; to enter Argilus, and from
thence to make the capital acquisition of Amphipolis.</p>

<p>Argilus was situated between Stageirus and the river Strymon,
along the western bank of which river its territory extended. Along
the eastern bank of the same river,—south of the lake which it
forms under the name of Kerkinitis, and north of the town of Eion
at its mouth, was situated the town and territory of Amphipolis,
communicating with the lands of Argilus by the important bridge there
situated. The Argilians were colonists from Andros, like Akanthus
and Stageirus, and the adhesion of those two cities to Brasidas gave
him opportunity to cultivate intelligences in Argilus, wherein there
had existed a standing discontent against Athens, ever since the
foundation of the neighboring city of Amphipolis.<a id="FNanchor_658"
href="#Footnote_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a> The latter city had
been established<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">[p. 407]</span>
by the Athenian Agnon, at the head of a numerous body of colonists,
on a spot belonging to the Edonian Thracians, called Ennea Hodoi,
or Nine Ways, about five years prior to the commencement of the war
(<small>B.C.</small> 437), after two previous attempts to colonize
it,—one by Histiæus and Aristagoras, at the period of the Ionic
revolt, and a second by the Athenians about 465 <small>B.C.</small>,
both of which lamentably failed. So valuable, however, was the
site, from its vicinity to the gold and silver mines near Mount
Pangæus and to large forests of ship-timber, as well as for command
of the Strymon, and for commerce with the interior of Thrace and
Macedonia, that the Athenians had sent a second expedition under
Agnon, who founded the city and gave it the name of Amphipolis. The
resident settlers there, however, were only in small proportion
Athenian citizens; the rest of mixed origin, some of them Argilian,
a considerable number Chalkidians. The Athenian general Euklês was
governor in the town, though seemingly with no paid force under his
command.</p>

<p>Among these mixed inhabitants a conspiracy was organized to
betray the town to Brasidas, the inhabitants of Argilus as well
as the Chalkidians each of them tampering with those of the same
race who resided in Amphipolis; and the influence of Perdikkas,
not inconsiderable, in consequence of the commerce of the place
with Macedonia, was employed to increase the number of partisans.
Of all the instigators, however, the most strenuous as well as the
most useful were the inhabitants of Argilus. Amphipolis, together
with the Athenians as its founders, had been odious to them from
its commencement; and its foundation had doubtless abridged their
commerce and importance as masters of the lower course of the
Strymon. They had been long laying snares against the city, and the
arrival of Brasidas now presented to them an unexpected chance of
success. It was they who enabled him to accomplish the surprise,
deferring proclamation of their own defection from Athens until they
could make it subservient to his conquest of Amphipolis.</p>

<p>Starting with his army from Arnê in the Chalkidic peninsula,
Brasidas arrived in the afternoon at Aulon and Bromiskus, near the
channel whereby the lake Bolbê is connected with the sea: from hence,
after his men had supped, he began his night-march to Amphipolis,
on a cold and snowy night of November, or<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_408">[p. 408]</span> the beginning of December. He reached
Argilus in the middle of the night, where the leaders at once
admitted him, proclaiming their revolt from Athens. With their
aid and guidance, he then hastened forward without delay to the
bridge across the Strymon, which he reached before break of day.<a
id="FNanchor_659" href="#Footnote_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a>
It was guarded only by a feeble piquet,—the town of Amphipolis
itself being situated on the hill at some little distance
higher up the river;<a id="FNanchor_660" href="#Footnote_660"
class="fnanchor">[660]</a> so that Brasidas, preceded by the Argilian
conspirators, surprised and overpowered the guard without difficulty.
Thus master of this important communication, he crossed with his army
forthwith into the territory of Amphipolis, where his arrival spread
the utmost dismay and terror. The governor Euklês, the magistrates,
and the citizens, were all found wholly unprepared: the lands
belonging to the city were occupied by residents, with their families
and property around them, calculating upon undisturbed security, as
if there had been no enemy within reach. Such of these as were close
to the city succeeded in running thither with their families, though
leaving their property exposed,—but the more distant became in person
as well as in property at the mercy of the invader. Even within
the town, filled with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">[p.
409]</span> friends and relatives of these victims without,
indescribable confusion reigned, of which the conspirators within
tried to avail themselves in order to get the gates thrown open. And
so complete was the disorganization, that if Brasidas had marched
up without delay to the gates and assaulted the town, many persons
supposed that he would have carried it at once. Such a risk, however,
was too great even for his boldness, the rather as repulse would
have been probably his ruin. Moreover, confiding in the assurances
of the conspirators that the gates would be thrown open, he thought
it safer to seize as many persons as he could from the out-citizens,
as a means of working upon the sentiments of those within the walls;
lastly, this process of seizure and plunder was probably more to the
taste of his own soldiers, and could not well be hindered.</p>

<p>But he waited in vain for the opening of the gates. The
conspirators in the city, in spite of the complete success of their
surprise and the universal dismay around them, found themselves
unable to carry the majority along with them. As in Akanthus, so
in Amphipolis, those who really hated Athens and wished to revolt
were only a party-minority; the greater number of citizens, at this
critical moment, stood by Euklês and the few native Athenians around
him in resolving upon defence, and in sending off an express to
Thucydidês (the historian) at Thasos, the colleague of Euklês, as
general in the region of Thrace, for immediate aid. This step, of
course immediately communicated to Brasidas from within, determined
him to make every effort for enticing the Amphipolitans to surrender
before the reinforcement should arrive; the rather, as he was
apprized that Thucydidês, being a large proprietor and worker of
gold mines in the neighboring region, possessed extensive personal
influence among the Thracian tribes, and would be able to bring them
together for the relief of the place, in conjunction with his own
Athenian squadron. He therefore sent in propositions for surrender
on the most favorable terms, guaranteeing to every citizen who chose
to remain, Amphipolitan or even Athenian, continued residence with
undisturbed property and equal political rights, and granting to
every one who chose to depart, five days for the purpose of carrying
away his property.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">[p. 410]</span></p>

<p>Such easy conditions, when made known in the city, produced
presently a sensible change of opinion among the citizens,
proving acceptable both to Athenians and Amphipolitans, though
on different grounds.<a id="FNanchor_661" href="#Footnote_661"
class="fnanchor">[661]</a> The properties of the citizens without, as
well as many of their relatives, were all in the hands of Brasidas:
no one counted upon the speedy arrival of reinforcement; and even
if it did arrive, the city might be preserved, but the citizens
without would still be either slain or made captive: a murderous
battle would ensue, and perhaps, after all, Brasidas, assisted by
the party within, might prove victorious. The Athenian citizens in
Amphipolis, knowing themselves to be exposed to peculiar danger, were
perfectly well pleased with his offer, as extricating them from a
critical position and procuring for them the means of escape, with
comparatively little loss; while the non-Athenian citizens, partakers
in the same relief from peril, felt little reluctance in accepting a
capitulation which preserved both their rights and their properties
inviolate, and merely severed them from Athens, towards which city
they felt, not hatred, but indifference. Above all, the friends and
relatives of the citizens exposed in the out-region were strenuous in
urging on the capitulation, so that the conspirators soon became bold
enough to proclaim themselves openly, insisting upon the moderation
of Brasidas and the prudence of admitting him. Euklês found that the
tone of opinion, even among his own Athenians, was gradually turned
against him, nor could he prevent the acceptance of the terms, and
the admission of the enemy into the city, on that same day.</p>

<p>No such resolution would have been adopted, had the citizens
been aware how near at hand Thucydidês and his forces were. The
message despatched early in the morning from Amphipolis found him
at Thasos with seven triremes; with which he instantly put to sea,
so as to reach Eion at the mouth of the Strymon, within three
miles of Amphipolis, on the same evening.<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_411">[p. 411]</span> He hoped to be in time for saving
Amphipolis, but the place had surrendered a few hours before. He
arrived, indeed, only just in time to preserve Eion; for parties
in that town were already beginning to concert the admission of
Brasidas, who would probably have entered it at daybreak the next
morning. Thucydidês, putting the place in a condition of defence,
successfully repelled an attack which Brasidas made both by land and
by boats on the river. He at the same time received and provided
for the Athenian citizens who were retiring from Amphipolis.<a
id="FNanchor_662" href="#Footnote_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a></p>

<p>The capture of this city, perhaps the most important of all the
foreign possessions of Athens, and the opening of the bridge over the
Strymon, by which even all her eastern allies became approachable by
land, occasioned prodigious emotion throughout all the Grecian world.
The dismay felt at Athens<a id="FNanchor_663" href="#Footnote_663"
class="fnanchor">[663]</a> was greater than had been ever before
experienced: hope and joy prevailed among her enemies, and excitement
and new aspirations became widely spread among her subject-allies.
The bloody defeat at Delium, and the unexpected conquests of
Brasidas, now again lowered the <i>prestige</i> of Athenian success,
sixteen months after it had been so powerfully exalted by the capture
of Sphakteria. The loss of reputation which Sparta had then incurred,
was now compensated by a reaction against the unfounded terrors
since conceived about the probable career of her enemy. It was not
merely the loss of Amphipolis, serious as that was, which distressed
the Athenians, but also their insecurity respecting the maintenance
of their whole empire: they knew not which of their subject-allies
might next revolt, in contemplation of aid from Brasidas, facilitated
by the newly-acquired Strymonian bridge. And as the proceedings
of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">[p. 412]</span> that general
counted in part to the credit of his country, it was believed
that Sparta, now for the first time shaking off her languor,<a
id="FNanchor_664" href="#Footnote_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a> had
taken to herself the rapidity and enterprise once regarded as the
exclusive characteristic of Athens. But besides all these chances
of evil to the Athenians, there was another yet more threatening,
the personal ascendency and position of Brasidas himself. It was not
merely the boldness, the fertility of aggressive resource, the quick
movements, the power of stimulating the minds of soldiers, which
lent efficiency to that general; but also his incorruptible probity,
his good faith, his moderation, his abstinence from party-cruelty or
jobbing, and from all intermeddling with the internal constitutions
of the different cities, in strict adherence to that manifesto
whereby Sparta had proclaimed herself the liberator of Greece. Such
talents and such official worth had never before been seen combined.
Set off as they were by the full brilliancy of successes such as
were deemed incredible before they actually occurred, they inspired
a degree of confidence and turned a tide of opinion towards this
eminent man which rendered him personally one of the first powers in
Greece. Numerous solicitations were transmitted to him at Amphipolis
from parties among the subject-allies of Athens, in their present
temper of large hopes from him and diminished fear of the Athenians:
the anti-Athenian party in each was impatient to revolt, the rest
of the population less restrained by fear.<a id="FNanchor_665"
href="#Footnote_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a></p>

<p>Of those who indulged in these sanguine calculations, many had
yet to learn by painful experience that Athens was still but little
abated in power: but her inaction during this important autumn had
been such as may well explain their mistake. It might have been
anticipated that, on hearing the alarming news of the junction of
Brasidas with the Chalkidians, and Perdikkas so close upon their
dependent allies, they would forthwith have sent a competent force
to Thrace, which, if despatched at that time, would probably have
obviated all the subsequent disasters.<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_413">[p. 413]</span> So they would have acted at any
other time, and perhaps even then, if Periklês had been alive.
But the news arrived just at the period when Athens was engaged
in the expedition against Bœotia, which ended very shortly in the
ruinous defeat of Delium. Under the discouragement arising from the
death of the stratêgus, Hippokratês, and one thousand citizens,
the idea of a fresh expedition to Thrace would probably have been
intolerable to Athenian hoplites: the hardships of a winter service
in Thrace, as experienced a few years before in the blockade of
Potidæa, would probably also aggravate their reluctance. In Grecian
history, we must steadfastly keep in mind that we are reading about
citizen soldiers, not about professional soldiers; and that the
temper of the time, whether of confidence or dismay, modifies to an
unspeakable degree all the calculations of military and political
prudence. Even after the rapid successes of Brasidas, not merely
at Akanthus and Stageirus, but even at Amphipolis, they sent only
a few inadequate guards<a id="FNanchor_666" href="#Footnote_666"
class="fnanchor">[666]</a> to the points most threatened, thus
leaving to their enterprising enemy the whole remaining winter for
his operations, without hindrance. Without depreciating the merits
of Brasidas, we may see that his extraordinary success was in great
part owing to the no less extraordinary depression which at that time
pervaded the Athenian public: a feeling encouraged by Nikias and
other leading men of the same party, who were building upon it in
order to get the Lacedæmonian proposals for peace accepted.</p>

<p>But while we thus notice the short-comings of Athens, in not
sending timely forces against Brasidas, we must at the same time
admit, that the most serious and irreparable loss which she
sustained, that of Amphipolis, was the fault of her officers more
than her own. Euklês, and the historian Thucydidês, the two joint
Athenian commanders in Thrace, to whom she had confided the defence
of that important town, had means amply sufficient to place it
beyond all risk of capture, if they had employed the most ordinary
vigilance and precaution beforehand. That Thucydidês became an
exile immediately after this event, and<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_414">[p. 414]</span> remained so for twenty years, is
certain from his own statement: and we hear, upon what in this case
is quite sufficient authority, that the Athenians condemned him,
probably Euklês also, to banishment, on the proposition of Kleon.<a
id="FNanchor_667" href="#Footnote_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a></p>

<p>In considering this sentence, historians<a id="FNanchor_668"
href="#Footnote_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a> commonly treat
Thucydidês as an innocent man, and find nothing to condemn except
the calumnies of the demagogue along with the injustice of the
people. But this view of the case cannot be sustained, when we bring
together all the facts even as indicated by Thucydidês himself. At
the moment when Brasidas surprised Amphipolis, Thucydidês was at
Thasos; and the event is always discussed as if he was there by
necessity or duty; as if Thasos was his special mission. Now we know
from his own statement that his command was not special or confined
to Thasos: he was sent as joint commander along with Euklês generally
to Thrace, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">[p. 415]</span>
especially to Amphipolis.<a id="FNanchor_669" href="#Footnote_669"
class="fnanchor">[669]</a> Both of them were jointly and severally
responsible for the proper defence of Amphipolis, with the Athenian
empire and interests in that quarter such nomination of two or more
officers, coördinate and jointly responsible, being the usual habit
of Athens, wherever the scale or the area of military operations was
considerable, instead of naming one supreme responsible commander,
with subordinate officers acting under him and responsible to him.
If, then, Thucydidês “was stationed at Thasos,” to use the phrase of
Dr. Thirlwall, this was because he chose to station himself there, in
the exercise of his own discretion.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the question which we have to put is, not whether
Thucydidês did all that could be done, after he received the alarming
express at Thasos, which is the part of the case that <i>he</i> sets
prominently before us, but whether he and Euklês jointly took the
best general measures for the security of the Athenian empire in
Thrace; especially for Amphipolis, the first jewel of her empire.
They suffer Athens to be robbed of that jewel, and how? Had they
a difficult position to defend? Were they<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_416">[p. 416]</span> overwhelmed by a superior force? Were
they distracted by simultaneous revolts in different places, or
assailed by enemies unknown or unforeseen? Not one of these grounds
for acquittal can be pleaded. First, their position was of all others
the most defensible: they had only to keep the bridge over the
Strymon adequately watched and guarded, or to retain the Athenian
squadron at Eion, and Amphipolis was safe. Either one or the other
of these precautions would have sufficed; both together would have
sufficed so amply, as probably to prevent the scheme of attack from
being formed. Next, the force under Brasidas was in noway superior,
not even adequate to the capture of the inferior place Eion, when
properly guarded, much less to that of Amphipolis. Lastly, there
were no simultaneous revolts to distract attention, nor unknown
enemies to confound a well-laid scheme of defence. There was but
one enemy, in one quarter, having one road by which to approach; an
enemy of surpassing merit, indeed, and eminently dangerous to Athens,
but without any chance of success except from the omissions of the
Athenian officers.</p>

<p>Now Thucydidês and Euklês both knew that Brasidas had prevailed
upon Akanthus and Stageirus to revolt, and that too in such a way
as to extend his own personal influence materially: they knew that
the population of Argilus was of Andrian origin,<a id="FNanchor_670"
href="#Footnote_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a> like that of
Akanthus and Stageirus, and therefore peculiarly likely to be
tempted by the example of those two towns. Lastly, they knew, and
Thucydidês himself tells us,<a id="FNanchor_671" href="#Footnote_671"
class="fnanchor">[671]</a> that this Argilian population—whose
territory bordered on the Strymon and the western foot of the bridge,
and who had many connections in Amphipolis—had been long disaffected
to Athens, and especially to the Athenian possession of that city.
Yet, having such foreknowledge, ample warning for the necessity of a
vigilant defence, Thucydidês and Euklês withdraw, or omit, both the
two precau<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">[p. 417]</span>tions
upon which the security of Amphipolis rested; precautions both of
them obvious, either of them sufficient. The one leaves the bridge
under a feeble guard,<a id="FNanchor_672" href="#Footnote_672"
class="fnanchor">[672]</a> and is caught so unprepared everywhere,
that one might suppose Athens to be in profound peace; the other is
found with his squadron, not at Eion, but at Thasos; an island out
of all possible danger, either from Brasidas, who had no ships, or
any other enemy. The arrival of Brasidas comes on both of them like a
clap of thunder. Nothing more is required than this plain fact, under
the circumstances, to prove their improvidence as commanders.</p>

<p>The presence of Thucydidês on the station of Thrace was important
to Athens, partly because he possessed valuable family connections,
mining property, and commanding influence among the continental
population round Amphipolis.<a id="FNanchor_673" href="#Footnote_673"
class="fnanchor">[673]</a> This was one main reason why he was named;
the Athenian people confiding partly in his private influence, over
and above the public force under his command, and looking to him,
even more than to his colleague Euklês, for the continued security of
the town: instead of which they find that not even their own squadron
under him is at hand near the vulnerable point, at the moment when
the enemy comes. Of the two, perhaps, the conduct of Euklês admits of
conceivable explanation more easily than that of Thucydidês. For it
seems that Euklês had no paid force in Amphipolis; only the citizen
hoplites, partly Athenian, partly of other lineage. Doubtless,
these men found it irksome to keep guard through the winter on the
Strymonian bridge: and Euklês might fancy that, by enforcing a
large perpetual guard, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">[p.
418]</span> ran the risk of making Athens unpopular: moreover, strict
constancy of watch, night after night, when no actual danger comes,
with an unpaid citizen force, is not easy to maintain. This is an
insufficient excuse, but it is better than anything which can be
offered on behalf of Thucydidês; who had with him a paid Athenian
force, and might just as well have kept it at Eion as at Thasos. We
may be sure that the absence of Thucydidês with his fleet, at Thasos,
was one essential condition in the plot laid by Brasidas with the
Argilians.</p>

<p>To say, with Dr. Thirlwall, that “human prudence and activity
could not have accomplished more than Thucydidês did, <i>under the
same circumstances</i>,” is true as matter of fact, and creditable as
far as it goes. But it is wholly inadmissible as a justification,
and meets only one part of the case. An officer in command is
responsible, not only for doing most “under the circumstances,” but
also for the circumstances themselves, in so far as they are under
his control; and nothing is more under his control than the position
which he chooses to occupy. If the emperor Napoleon, or the duke of
Wellington, had lost, by surprise of an enemy not very numerous, a
post of supreme importance which they thought adequately protected,
would they be satisfied to hear from a responsible officer in
command: “Having no idea that the enemy would attempt any surprise,
I thought that I might keep my force half a day’s journey off from
the post exposed, at another post which it was physically impossible
for the enemy to reach; but, the moment I was informed that the
surprise had occurred, I hastened to the scene, did all that human
prudence and activity could do to repel the enemy; and though I found
that he had already mastered the capital post of all, yet I beat
him back from a second post which he was on the point of mastering
also?” Does any one imagine that these illustrious chiefs, smarting
under the loss of an inestimable position which alters the whole
prospects of a campaign, would be satisfied with such a report, and
would dismiss the officer with praises for his vigor and bravery,
“under the circumstances?” They would most assuredly reply, that he
had done right in coming back, that his conduct after coming back
had been that of a brave man, and that there was no impeachment on
his courage. But they would at the same time add, that his want of
judgment and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">[p. 419]</span>
foresight, in omitting to place the valuable position really exposed
under sufficient guard beforehand, and leaving it thus open to the
enemy, while he himself was absent in another place which was out of
danger, and his easy faith that there would be no dangerous surprise,
at a time when the character of the enemy’s officer, as well as the
disaffection of the neighbors (Argilus), plainly indicated that there
<i>would</i> be, if the least opening were afforded, that these were
defects meriting serious reproof, and disqualifying him from any
future command of trust and responsibility. Nor can we doubt that the
whole feeling of the respective armies, who would have to pay with
their best blood the unhappy miscalculation of this officer, would go
along with such a sentence; without at all suspecting themselves to
be guilty of injustice, or of “directing the irritation produced by
the loss against an innocent object.”</p>

<p>The vehement leather-seller in the Pnyx, at Athens, when he
brought forward what are called “his calumnies” against Thucydidês
and Euklês, as having caused, through culpable omission, a fatal
and irreparable loss to their country, might perhaps state his case
with greater loudness and acrimony; but it may be doubted whether he
would say anything more really galling than would be contained in
the dignified rebuke of an esteemed modern general to a subordinate
officer under similar circumstances. In my judgment, not only the
accusation against these two officers—I assume Euklês to have been
included—was called for on the fairest <i>presumptive</i> grounds, which
would be sufficient as a justification of the leather-sell Kleon,
but the positive verdict of guilty against them was fully merited.
Whether the banishment inflicted was a greater penalty than the case
warranted, I will not take upon me to pronounce. Every age has its
own standard of feeling for measuring what is a proper intensity of
punishment: penalties which our grandfathers thought right and meet,
would in the present day appear intolerably rigorous. But when I
consider the immense value of Amphipolis to Athens, combined with the
conduct whereby it was lost, I cannot think that there was a single
Athenian, or a single Greek, who would deem the penalty of banishment
too severe.</p>

<p>It is painful to find such strong grounds of official
censure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">[p. 420]</span> against
a man who, as an historian, has earned the lasting admiration of
posterity,—my own, among the first and warmest. But in criticizing
the conduct of Thucydidês the officer, we are bound in common
justice to forget Thucydidês the historian. He was not known in the
latter character, at the time when this sentence was passed: perhaps
he never would have been so known, like the Neapolitan historian
Colletta, if exile had not thrown him out of the active duties and
hopes of a citizen. It may be doubted whether he ever went home from
Eion to encounter the grief, wrath, and alarm, so strongly felt
at Athens after the loss of Amphipolis. Condemned, either with or
without appearance, he remained in banishment for twenty years;<a
id="FNanchor_674" href="#Footnote_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a>
nor did he return to Athens until after the conclusion of the
Peloponnesian war. Of this long exile, much is said to have been
spent on his property in Thrace: yet he also visited most parts of
Greece, enemies of Athens as well as neutral states. However much
we may deplore such a misfortune on his account, mankind in general
have, and ever will have, the strongest reason to rejoice at it. To
this compulsory leisure we owe the completion, or rather the near
approach to completion, of his history: nor is it less certain that
the opportunities which an exile enjoyed of personally consulting
neutrals and enemies, contributed much to form that impartial,
comprehensive, Pan-Hellenic spirit, which reigns generally throughout
his immortal work.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Brasidas, installed in Amphipolis about the beginning
of December, 424 <small>B.C.</small>, employed his
increased power only the more vigorously against Athens. His first
care was to reconstitute Amphipolis; a task wherein the Macedonian
Perdikkas, whose intrigues had contributed to the capture, came
and personally assisted. That city was going through a partial
secession and renovation of inhabitants, and was now moreover cut
off from the port of Eion and the mouth of the river, which remained
in the hands of the Athenians. Many new arrangements must have
been required, as well for its internal polity as for its external
defence. Brasidas took measures for building ships of war, in the
lake above the city, in order to force the lower part of the river:<a
id="FNanchor_675" href="#Footnote_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a>
but his most important step was to construct a<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_421">[p. 421]</span> palisade work,<a id="FNanchor_676"
href="#Footnote_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a> connecting the
walls of the city with the bridge. He thus made himself permanently
master of the crossing of the Strymon, so as to shut the door by
which he himself had entered, and at the same time to keep an easy
communication with Argilus and the western bank of the Strymon.
He also made some acquisitions on the eastern side of the river.
Pittakus, prince of the neighboring Edonian-Thracian township of
Myrkinus, had been recently assassinated by his wife Brauro, and by
some personal enemies: he had probably been the ally of Athens, and
his assassins now sought to strengthen themselves by courting the
alliance of the new conqueror of Amphipolis. The Thasian continental
colonies of Galêpsus and Œsymê also declared their adhesion to
him.</p>

<p>While he sent to Lacedæmon, communicating his excellent position
as well as his large hopes, he at the same time, without waiting
for the answer, began acting for himself, with all the allies whom
he could get together. He marched first against the peninsula
called Aktê,—the narrow tongue of land which stretches out from
the neighborhood of Akanthus to the mighty headland called Mount
Athos,—near thirty miles long, and between four and five miles for
the most part in breadth.<a id="FNanchor_677" href="#Footnote_677"
class="fnanchor">[677]</a> The long, rugged, woody ridge,—covering
this peninsula so as to leave but narrow spaces for dwelling or
cultivation, or feeding of cattle,—was at this time occupied by
many distinct petty communities, some of them divided in race
and language. Sanê, a colony from Andros, was situated in the
interior gulf, called the Singitic gulf, between Athos and the
Sithonian peninsula, near the Xerxeian canal: the rest of the
Aktê was distributed among Bisaltians, Krestônians, and Edonians,
all fractions of the Thracian name; Pelasgians, or Tyrrhenians,
of the race which had once occupied Lemnos and Imbros, and some
Chalkidians. Some of these little communities spoke habitually two
languages. Thyssus, Kleône, Olophyxus, and others, all submitted on
the arrival<span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">[p. 422]</span> of
Brasidas; but Sanê and Dion held out, nor could he bring them to
terms even by ravaging their territory.</p>

<p>He next marched into the Sithonian peninsula, to attack Torônê,
situated near the southern extremity of that peninsula, opposite to
Cape Kanastræum, the extreme headland of the peninsula of Pallênê.<a
id="FNanchor_678" href="#Footnote_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a></p>

<p>Torônê was inhabited by a Chalkidic population, but had not
partaken in the revolt of the neighboring Chalkidians against Athens.
A small Athenian garrison had been sent there, probably since the
recent dangers, and were now defending it, as well as repairing
the town-wall in various parts where it had been so neglected as
to crumble down. They occupied as a sort of distinct citadel the
outlying cape called Lêkythus, joining by a narrow isthmus the hill
on which the city stood, and forming a port wherein lay two Athenian
triremes as guard-ships. A small party in Torônê, without privity<a
id="FNanchor_679" href="#Footnote_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a>
or even suspicion of the rest, entered into correspondence with
Brasidas, and engaged to provide for him the means of entering and
mastering the town. Accordingly, he advanced by a night-march to the
temple of the Dioskuri, Kastor and Pollux, within about a quarter of
a mile of the town-gates, which he reached a little before daybreak,
sending forward one hundred peltasts to be still nearer, and to rush
upon the gate at the instant when signal was made from within. His
Torônæan partisans, some of whom were already concealed on the spot,
awaiting his arrival, made their final arrangements with him, and
then returned into the town, conducting with them seven determined
men from his army, armed only with daggers, and having Lysistratus
of Olynthus as their chief: twenty men had been originally named
for this service, but the danger appeared so extreme, that only
seven of them were bold enough to go. This forlorn hope, enabled to
creep in, through a small aperture in the wall towards the sea, were
conducted silently up to the topmost watch-tower on the city hill,
where they surprised and slew the guards, and set open a neighboring
postern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_423">[p. 423]</span> gate,
looking towards Cape Kanastræum, as well as the great gate leading
towards the agora. They then brought in the peltasts from without,
who, impatient with the delay, had gradually stolen closely under
the walls: some of these peltasts kept possession of the great
gate, others were led round to the postern at the top, while the
fire-signal was forthwith lighted to invite Brasidas himself. He and
his men hastened forward towards the city at their utmost speed and
with loud shouts, a terror-striking notice of his presence to the
unprepared citizens. Admission was easy through the open gates, but
some also clambered up by means of beams or a sort of scaffolding,
which was lying close to the wall as a help to the workmen repairing
it. And while the assailants were thus active in every direction,
Brasidas himself conducted a portion of them, to assure himself of
the high and commanding parts of the city.</p>

<p>So completely were the Torônæans surprised and thunderstruck,
that hardly any attempt was made to resist. Even the fifty Athenian
hoplites who occupied the agora, being found still asleep,
were partly slain, and partly compelled to seek refuge in the
separately-garrisoned cape of Lêkythus, whither they were followed by
a portion of the Torônæan population; some from attachment to Athens,
others from sheer terror. To these fugitives Brasidas addressed a
proclamation, inviting them to return, and promising them perfect
security, for person, property, and political rights; while at the
same time he sent a herald with a formal summons to the Athenians
in Lêkythus, requiring them to quit the place as belonging to the
Chalkidians, but permitting them to carry away their property. They
refused to evacuate the place, but solicited a truce of one day for
the purpose of burying their slain. Brasidas granted them two days,
which were employed both by them and by him in preparations for the
defence and attack of Lêkythus; each party fortifying the houses on
or near the connecting isthmus.</p>

<p>In the mean time he convened a general assembly of the Torônæan
population, whom he addressed in the same conciliating and equitable
language as he had employed elsewhere. “He had not come to harm
either the city, or any individual citizen. Those who had let him
in, ought not to be regarded as bad men or traitors, for they had
acted with a view to the benefit and the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_424">[p. 424]</span> liberation of their city, not in
order to enslave it, or to acquire profit for themselves. On the
other hand, he did not think the worse of those who had gone over
to Lêkythus, for their liking towards Athens: he wished them to
come back freely; and he was sure that the more they knew the
Lacedæmonians the better they would esteem them. He was prepared to
forgive and forget previous hostility, but while he invited all of
them to live for the future as cordial friends and fellow-citizens,
he should also for the future hold each man responsible for his
conduct, either as friend or as enemy.”</p>

<p>On the expiration of the two days’ truce, Brasidas attacked
the Athenian garrison in Lêkythus, promising a recompense of
thirty minæ to the soldier who should first force his way into it.
Notwithstanding very poor means of defence, partly a wooden palisade,
partly houses with battlements on the roof, this garrison repelled
him for one whole day: on the next morning he brought up a machine,
for the same purpose as that which the Bœotians had employed at
Delium, to set fire to the woodwork. The Athenians on their side,
seeing this fire-machine approaching, put up, on a building in
front of their position, a wooden scaffolding, upon which many of
them mounted, with casks of water and large stones to break it or
to extinguish the flames. At last, the weight accumulated becoming
greater than the scaffolding could support, it broke down with a
prodigious noise; so that all the persons and things upon it rolled
down in confusion. Some of these men were hurt, yet the injury was
not in reality serious; had not the noise, the cries, and strangeness
of the incident alarmed those behind, who could not see precisely
what had occurred, to such a degree, that they believed the enemy
to have already forced the defences. Many of them accordingly took
to flight, and those who remained were insufficient to prolong
the resistance successfully; so that Brasidas, perceiving the
disorder and diminished number of the defenders, relinquished his
fire-machine, and again renewed his attempt to carry the place by
assault, which now fully succeeded. A considerable proportion of
the Athenians and others in the fort escaped across the narrow gulf
to the peninsula of Pallênê, by means of the two triremes and some
merchant-vessels at hand: but every man found in it was put to death.
Brasidas, thus master of the fort, and con<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_425">[p. 425]</span>sidering that he owed his success to the
sudden rupture of the Athenian scaffolding, regarded this incident as
a divine interposition, and presented the thirty minæ, which he had
promised as a reward to the first man who broke in, to the goddess
Athênê, for her temple at Lêkythus. He moreover consecrated to her
the entire cape of Lêkythus; not only demolishing the defences,
but also dismantling the private residences which it contained,<a
id="FNanchor_680" href="#Footnote_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a>
so that nothing remained except the temple, with its ministers and
appurtenances.</p>

<p>What proportion of the Torônæans who had taken refuge at Lêkythus
had been induced to return by the proclamation of Brasidas, alike
generous and politic, we are not informed. His language and conduct
were admirably calculated to set this little community again in
harmonious movement, and to obliterate the memory of past feuds.
And above all, it inspired a strong sentiment of attachment and
gratitude towards himself personally; a sentiment which gained
strength with every successive incident in which he was engaged,
and which enabled him to exercise a greater ascendency than could
ever be acquired by Sparta, and in some respects greater than had
ever been possessed by Athens. It is this remarkable development of
commanding individuality, animated throughout by straightforward
public purposes, and binding together so many little communities who
had few other feelings in common, which lends to the short career of
this eminent man a romantic and even an heroic interest.</p>

<p>During the remainder of the winter Brasidas employed himself
in setting in order the acquisitions already made, and in laying
plans for farther conquests in the spring.<a id="FNanchor_681"
href="#Footnote_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a> But the beginning of
spring—or the close of the eighth year, and beginning of the ninth
year of the war, as Thucydidês reckons—brought with it a new train of
events, which will be recounted in the following chapter.</p>

    TRUCE FOR ONE YEAR.—RENEWAL OF WAR AND BATTLE OF
    AMPHIPOLIS.—PEACE OF NIKIAS.</h2>
</div>

<p class="ti0"><span class="smcap">The</span> eighth year of the war,
described in the last chapter, had opened with sanguine hopes for
Athens, and with dark promise for Sparta, chiefly in consequence of
the memorable capture of Sphakteria towards the end of the preceding
summer. It included, not to mention other events, two considerable
and important enterprises on the part of Athens, against Megara and
against Bœotia; the former plan, partially successful, the latter,
not merely unsuccessful, but attended with a ruinous defeat. Lastly,
the losses in Thrace, following close upon the defeat at Delium,
together with the unbounded expectations everywhere entertained
from the future career of Brasidas, had again seriously lowered the
impression entertained of Athenian power. The year thus closed amidst
humiliations the more painful to Athens, as contrasted with the
glowing hopes with which it had begun.</p>

<p>It was now that Athens felt the full value of those prisoners
whom she had taken at Sphakteria. With those prisoners, as Kleon and
his supporters had said truly, she might be sure of making peace
whenever she desired it.<a id="FNanchor_682" href="#Footnote_682"
class="fnanchor">[682]</a> Having such a certainty to fall back
upon, she had played a bold game, and aimed at larger acquisitions
during the past year; and this speculation, though not in itself
unreasonable, had failed: moreover, a new phenomenon, alike
unexpected by all, had occurred, when Brasidas broke open and cut up
her empire in Thrace. Still, so great was the anxiety of the Spartans
to regain their captives, who had powerful friends and relatives at
home, that they considered the victories of Brasidas chiefly as a
stepping-stone towards that object, and as a means of prevailing upon
Athens to make peace. To his animated representations sent home from
Amphipolis, setting forth the prospects of still farther success and
entreating reinforcements, they had returned a discouraging reply,
dictated in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">[p. 427]</span> no
small degree by the miserable jealousy of some of their chief men;<a
id="FNanchor_683" href="#Footnote_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a>
who, feeling themselves cast into the shade, and looking upon
his splendid career as an eccentric movement breaking loose from
Spartan routine, were thus on personal as well as political grounds
disposed to labor for peace. Such collateral motives, working upon
the caution usual with Sparta, determined her to make use of the
present fortune and realized conquests of Brasidas as a basis for
negotiation and recovery of the prisoners; without opening the
chance of ulterior enterprises, which though they might perhaps
end in results yet more triumphant, would unavoidably put in risk
that which was now secure.<a id="FNanchor_684" href="#Footnote_684"
class="fnanchor">[684]</a> The history of the Athenians during the
past year might, indeed, serve as a warning to deter the Spartans
from playing an adventurous game.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">[p. 428]</span></p>

<p>Ever since the capture of Sphakteria, the Lacedæmonians had been
attempting, directly or indirectly, negotiations for peace<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_429">[p. 429]</span> and the recovery
of the prisoners; their pacific dispositions being especially
instigated by king Pleistoanax, whose peculiar<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_430">[p. 430]</span> circumstances gave him a strong motive
to bring the war to a close. He had been banished from Sparta,
fourteen years before the commencement of the war, and a little
before the thirty years’ truce, under the charge of having taken
bribes from the Athenians on occasion of invading Attica. For more
than eighteen years, he lived in banishment, close to the temple of
Zeus Lykæus, in Arcadia; in such constant fear of the Lacedæmonians,
that his dwelling-house was half within the consecrated ground.<a
id="FNanchor_685" href="#Footnote_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a>
But he never lost the hope of procuring restoration, through the
medium of the Pythian priestess at Delphi, whom he and his brother
Aristoklês kept in their pay. To every sacred legation which went
from Sparta to Delphi, she repeated the same imperative injunction:
“They must bring back the seed of (Hêraklês) the demi-god son of
Zeus, from foreign land to their own: if they did not, it would be
their fate to plough with a silver ploughshare.” The command of the
god, thus incessantly repeated and backed by the influence of those
friends who supported Pleistoanax at home, at length produced an
entire change of sentiment at Sparta. In the fourth or fifth year
of the Peloponnesian war, the exile was recalled; and not merely
recalled, but welcomed with unbounded honors, received with the same
sacrifices and choric shows as those which were said to have been
offered to the primitive kings, on the first settlement of Sparta.</p>

<p>As in the case of Kleomenês and Demaratus, however, it was
not long before the previous intrigue came to be detected, or at
least generally suspected and believed; to the great discredit of
Pleistoanax, though he could not be again banished. Every successive
public calamity which befell the state, the miscarriages of
Alkidas, the defeat of Eurylochus in Amphilochia, and above<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_431">[p. 431]</span> all, the unprecedented
humiliation in Sphakteria, were imputed to the displeasure of
the gods in consequence of the impious treachery of Pleistoanax.
Suffering under such an imputation, this king was most eager to
exchange the hazards of war for the secure march of peace, so
that he was thus personally interested in opening every door for
negotiation with Athens, and in restoring himself to credit by
regaining the prisoners.<a id="FNanchor_686" href="#Footnote_686"
class="fnanchor">[686]</a></p>

<p>After the battle of Delium,<a id="FNanchor_687"
href="#Footnote_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a> the pacific
dispositions of Nikias, Lachês, and the philo-Laconian party,
began to find increasing favor at Athens;<a id="FNanchor_688"
href="#Footnote_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a> while the unforeseen
losses in Thrace, coming thick upon each other, each successive
triumph of Brasidas apparently increasing his means of achieving
more, tended to convert the discouragement of the Athenians into
positive alarm. Negotiations appear to have been in progress
throughout great part of the winter: and the continual hope that
these might be brought to a close, combined with the impolitic
aversion of Nikias and his friends to energetic military action, help
to explain the unwonted apathy of Athens, under the pressure of such
disgraces. But so much did her courage flag, towards the close of
the winter, that she came to look upon a truce as her only means<a
id="FNanchor_689" href="#Footnote_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a>
of preservation against the victorious progress of Brasidas. What
the tone of Kleon now was, we are not directly informed: he would
probably still continue opposed to the propositions of peace, at
least indirectly, by insisting on terms more favorable than could
be obtained. On this point, his political counsels would be wrong;
but on another point, they would be much sounder and more judicious
than those of his rival Nikias: for he would recommend a strenuous
prosecution of hostilities by Athenian force against Brasidas in
Thrace. At the present moment this was the most urgent political
necessity of Athens, whether she entertained or rejected the views
of peace: and the policy of Nikias, who cradled up the existing
depression of the citizens by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_432">[p.
432]</span> encouraging them to rely on the pacific inclinations of
Sparta, was ill-judged and disastrous in its results, as the future
will hereafter show.</p>

<p>Attempts were made by the peace-party both at Athens and Sparta
to negotiate at first for a definitive peace: but the conditions
of such a peace were not easy to determine, so as to satisfy both
parties, and became more and more difficult, with every success
of Brasidas. At length the Athenians, eager above all things to
arrest his progress, sent to Sparta to propose a truce for one year,
desiring the Spartans to send to Athens envoys with full powers to
settle the terms: the truce would allow time and tranquillity for
settling the conditions of a definitive treaty. The proposition of
the truce for one year,<a id="FNanchor_690" href="#Footnote_690"
class="fnanchor">[690]</a> together with the first two articles ready
prepared, came from Athens, as indeed we might have presumed even
without proof; since the interest of Sparta was rather against it, as
allowing to the Athenians the fullest leisure for making preparations
against farther losses in Thrace. But her main desire was, not so
much to put herself in condition to make the best possible peace,
as to insure some peace which would liberate her captives: and she
calculated that when once the Athenians had tasted the sweets of
peace for one year, they would not again voluntarily impose upon
themselves the rigorous obligations of war.<a id="FNanchor_691"
href="#Footnote_691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a></p>

<p>In the month of March, 423 <small>B.C.</small>,
on the fourteenth day of the month Elaphebolion at Athens, and
on the twelfth day of the month Gerastius at Sparta, a truce for
one year was concluded and sworn, between Athens on one side, and
Sparta, Corinth, Sikyon, Epidaurus, and Megara, on the other.<a
id="FNanchor_692" href="#Footnote_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a> The
Spartans, instead of merely despatching plenipotentiaries to Athens
as the Athenians had desired, went a step farther: in concurrence
with the Athenian envoys, they drew up a form of truce, approved
by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_433">[p. 433]</span> themselves
and their allies, in such manner that it only required to be adopted
and ratified by the Athenians. The general principle of the truce
was <i>uti possidetis</i>, and the conditions were in substance as
follows:—</p>

<p>1. Respecting the temple at Delphi, every Greek shall have
the right to make use of it honestly and without fear, pursuant
to the customs of his particular city. The main purpose of this
stipulation, prepared and sent verbatim from Athens, was to
allow Athenian visitors to go thither, which had been impossible
during the war, in consequence of the hostility of the Bœotians<a
id="FNanchor_693" href="#Footnote_693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a>
and Phocians: the Delphian authorities also were in the interest of
Sparta, and doubtless the Athenians received no formal invitation
to the Pythian games. But the Bœotians and Phocians were no parties
to the truce: accordingly the Lacedæmonians, while accepting the
article and proclaiming the general liberty in principle, do not
pledge themselves to enforce it by arms as far as the Bœotians
and Phocians are concerned, but only to try and persuade them by
amicable representations. The liberty of sacrificing at Delphi was
at this moment the more welcome to the Athenians, as they seem
to have fancied themselves under the displeasure of Apollo.<a
id="FNanchor_694" href="#Footnote_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a></p>

<p>2. All the contracting parties will inquire out and punish, each
according to its own laws, such persons as may violate the property
of the Delphian god.<a id="FNanchor_695" href="#Footnote_695"
class="fnanchor">[695]</a> This article also is prepared at Athens,
for the purpose seemingly of conciliating the favor of<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_434">[p. 434]</span> Apollo and the
Delphians. The Lacedæmonians accept the article literally, of
course.</p>

<p>3. The Athenian garrisons at Pylus, Kythêra, Nisæa, and Minôa, and
Methana in the neighborhood of Trœzen, are to remain as at present.
No communication to take place between Kythêra and any portion of
the mainland belonging to the Lacedæmonian alliance. The soldiers
occupying Pylus shall confine themselves within the space between
Buphras and Tomeus; those in Nisæa and Minôa, within the road which
leads from the chapel of the hero Nisus to the temple of Poseidon,
without any communication with the population beyond that limit.
In like manner, the Athenians in the peninsula of Methana near
Trœzen, and the inhabitants of the latter city, shall observe the
special convention concluded between them respecting boundaries.<a
id="FNanchor_696" href="#Footnote_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a></p>

<p>4. The Lacedæmonians and their allies shall make use of the sea
for trading purposes, on their own coasts, but shall not have liberty
to sail in any ship of war, nor in any rowed merchant-vessel of
tonnage equal to five hundred talents. [All war-ships were generally
impelled by oar: they sometimes used sails, but never when wanted for
fighting. Merchant-vessels seem generally to have sailed, but were
sometimes rowed: the limitation of size is added, to insure that the
Lacedæmonians shall not, under color of merchantmen, get up a warlike
navy.]</p>

<p>5. There shall be free communication by sea as well as by land
between Peloponnesus and Athens for herald or embassy with suitable
attendants, to treat for a definitive peace or for the adjustment of
differences.</p>

<p>6. Neither side shall receive deserters from the other, whether
free or slave. [This article was alike important to both parties.
Athens had to fear the revolt of her subject-allies, Sparta the
desertion of Helots.]</p>

<p>7. Disputes shall be amicably settled, by both parties, according
to their established laws and customs.</p>

<p>Such was the substance of the treaty prepared at Sparta, seemingly
in concert with Athenian envoys, and sent by the Spartans to Athens
for approval, with the following addition:<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_435">[p. 435]</span> “If there be any provision which occurs
to you, more honorable or just than these, come to Lacedæmon and tell
us: for neither the Spartans nor their allies will resist any just
suggestions. But let those who come, bring with them full powers to
conclude, in the same manner as you desire of us. The truce shall be
for one year.”</p>

<p>By the resolution which Lachês proposed in the Athenian public
assembly, ratifying the truce, the people farther decreed that
negotiations should be open for a definitive treaty, and directed
the stratêgi to propose to the next ensuing assembly, a scheme and
principles for conducting the negotiations. But at the very moment
when the envoys between Sparta and Athens were bringing the truce to
final adoption, events happened in Thrace which threatened to cancel
it altogether. Two days<a id="FNanchor_697" href="#Footnote_697"
class="fnanchor">[697]</a> after the important fourteenth of
Elaphebolion, but before the truce could be made known in Thrace,
Skiônê revolted from Athens to Brasidas.</p>

<p>Skiônê was a town calling itself Achæan, one of the numerous
colonies which, in the want of an acknowledged mother city, traced
its origin to warriors returning from Troy. It was situated in the
peninsula of Pallênê (the westernmost of those three narrow tongues
of land into which Chalkidikê branches out); conterminous with the
Eretrian colony Mendê. The Skiônæans, not without considerable
dissent among themselves, proclaimed their revolt from Athens, under
concert with Brasidas. He immediately crossed the gulf into Pallênê,
himself in a little boat, but with a trireme close at his side;
calculating that she would protect him against any small Athenian
vessel,—while any Athenian trireme which he might encounter would
attack his trireme, paying no attention to the little boat in which
he himself was. The revolt of Skiônê was, from the position of the
town, a more striking defiance of Athens than any of the preceding
events. For the isthmus connecting Pallênê with the mainland was
occupied by the town of Potidæa, a town assigned at the period of
its capture seven years before to Athenian settlers, though probably
containing some other residents besides. Moreover, the isthmus was
so narrow, that the wall of Potidæa barred<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_436">[p. 436]</span> it across completely from sea to
sea: Pallênê was therefore a quasi-island, not open to the aid of
land-force from the continent, like the towns previously acquired
by Brasidas. The Skiônæans thus put themselves, without any foreign
aid, into conflict against the whole force of Athens, bringing into
question her empire not merely over continental towns, but over
islands.</p>

<p>Even to Brasidas himself their revolt appeared a step of
astonishing boldness. On being received into the city, he convened a
public assembly, and addressed to them the same language which he had
employed at Akanthus and Torônê, disavowing all party preferences as
well as all interference with the internal politics of the town, and
exhorting them only to unanimous efforts against the common enemy.
He bestowed upon them at the same time the warmest praise for their
courage. “They, though exposed to all hazards of islanders, had stood
forward of their own accord to procure freedom,<a id="FNanchor_698"
href="#Footnote_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a> without waiting like
cowards to be driven on by a foreign force towards what was clearly
their own good. He considered them capable of any measure of future
heroism, if the danger now impending from Athens should be averted,
and he should assign to them the very first post of honor among the
faithful allies of Lacedæmon.” This generous, straightforward, and
animating tone of exhortation, appealing to the strongest political
instinct of the Greek mind, the love of complete city autonomy,
and coming from the lips of one whose whole conduct had hitherto
been conformable to it, had proved highly efficacious in all the
previous towns. But in Skiônê it roused the population to the highest
pitch of enthusiasm:<a id="FNanchor_699" href="#Footnote_699"
class="fnanchor">[699]</a> it worked even upon the feelings of the
dissentient minority, bringing them round to partake heartily in the
movement: it produced a unanimous and exalted confidence which made
them look forward cheerfully to all the desperate chances in which
they had engaged themselves; and it produced at the same time, in
still more unbounded manifestation, the same personal attachment and
admiration as Brasidas inspired elsewhere. The Skiônæans not only
voted to him publicly a golden crown, as the liberator of Greece,
but when it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_437">[p. 437]</span> was
placed on his head, the burst of individual sentiment and sympathy
was the strongest of which the Grecian bosom was capable. “They
crowded round him individually, and encircled his head with fillets,
like a victorious athlete,”<a id="FNanchor_700" href="#Footnote_700"
class="fnanchor">[700]</a> says the historian. This remarkable
incident illustrates what I observed before, that the achievements,
the self-relying march, the straightforward politics and probity
of this illustrious man, who in character was more Athenian than
Spartan, yet with the good qualities of Athens predominant, inspired
a personal emotion towards him such as rarely found its way into
Grecian political life. The sympathy and admiration felt in Greece
towards a victorious athlete was not merely an intense sentiment
in the Grecian mind, but was, perhaps of all others, the most
wide-spread and Pan-Hellenic. It was connected with the religion,
the taste, and the love of recreation, common to the whole nation,
while politics tended rather to disunite the separate cities: it was
farther a sentiment at once familiar and exclusively personal. Of
its exaggerated intensity throughout Greece the philosophers often
complained, not without good reason; but Thucydidês cannot convey a
more lively idea of the enthusiasm and unanimity with which Brasidas
was welcomed at Skiônê, just after the desperate resolution taken by
the citizens, than by using this simile.</p>

<p>The Lacedæmonian commander knew well how much the utmost
resolution of the Skiônæans was needed, and how speedily their
insular position would draw upon them the vigorous invasion of
Athens. He accordingly brought across to Pallênê a considerable
portion of his army, not merely with a view to the defence of Skiônê,
but also with the intention of surprising both Mendê and Potidæa, in
both which places there were small parties of conspirators prepared
to open the gates.</p>

<p>It was in this position that he was found by the commissioners
who came to announce formally the conclusion of the truce for one
year, and to enforce its provisions: Athenæus from Sparta,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_438">[p. 438]</span> one of the three
Spartans who had sworn to the treaty: Aristonymus, from Athens.
The face of affairs was materially altered by this communication;
much to the satisfaction of the newly acquired allies of Sparta in
Thrace, who accepted the truce forthwith, but to the great chagrin
of Brasidas, whose career was thus suddenly arrested. But he could
not openly refuse obedience, and his army was accordingly transferred
from the peninsula of Pallênê to Torônê.</p>

<p>The case of Skiônê, however, immediately raised an obstruction,
doubtless very agreeable to him. The commissioners who had come in
an Athenian trireme, had heard nothing of the revolt of that place,
and Aristonymus was astonished to find the enemy in Pallênê. But on
inquiring into the case, he discovered that the Skiônæans had not
revolted until two days after the day fixed for the commencement
of the truce: accordingly, while sanctioning the truce for all the
other cities in Thrace, he refused to comprehend Skiônê in it,
sending immediate news home to Athens. Brasidas, protesting loudly
against this proceeding, refused on his part to abandon Skiônê,
which was peculiarly endeared to him by the recent scenes; and
even obtained the countenance of the Lacedæmonian commissioners,
by falsely asseverating that the city had revolted before the day
named in the truce. Violent was the burst of indignation when the
news sent home by Aristonymus reached Athens: nor was it softened,
when the Lacedæmonians, acting upon the version of the case sent to
them by Brasidas and Athenæus, despatched an embassy hither to claim
protection for Skiônê, or at any rate to procure the adjustment
of the dispute by arbitration or pacific decision. Having the
terms of the treaty on their side, the Athenians were least of all
disposed to relax from their rights in favor of the first revolting
islanders. They resolved at once to undertake an expedition for the
reconquest of Skiônê; and farther, on the proposition of Kleon,
to put to death all the adult male inhabitants of that place as
soon as it should have been reconquered. At the same time, they
showed no disposition to throw up the truce generally; and the
state of feeling on both sides tended to this result, that, while
the war continued in Thrace, it was suspended everywhere else.<a
id="FNanchor_701" href="#Footnote_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_439">[p. 439]</span></p>
<p>Fresh intelligence soon arrived, carrying exasperation at
Athens yet farther, of the revolt of Mendê, the adjoining town to
Skiônê. Those Mendæans, who had laid their measures for secretly
introducing Brasidas, were at first baffled by the arrival of the
truce-commissioners; but they saw that he retained his hold on
Skiônê, in spite of the provisions of the truce, and they ascertained
that he was willing still to protect them if they revolted, though
he could not be an accomplice, as originally projected, in the
surprise of the town. Being, moreover, only a small party, with the
sentiment of the population against them, they were afraid, if they
now relinquished their scheme, of being detected and punished for the
partial steps already taken, when the Athenians should come against
Skiônê. They therefore thought it on the whole the least dangerous
course to persevere. They proclaimed their revolt from Athens,
constraining the reluctant citizens to obey them:<a id="FNanchor_702"
href="#Footnote_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a> the government seems
before to have been democratical, but they now found means to bring
about an oligarchical revolution along with the revolt. Brasidas
immediately accepted their adhesion, and willingly undertook to
protect them, professing to think that he had a right to do so,
because they had revolted openly after the truce had been proclaimed.
But the truce upon this point was clear, which he himself virtually
admitted, by setting up as justification certain alleged matters in
which the Athenians had themselves violated it. He immediately made
preparation for the defence both of Mendê and Skiônê against the
attack, which was now rendered more certain than before, conveying
the women and children of those two towns across to the Chalkidic
Olynthus, and sending thither as garrison<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_440">[p. 440]</span> five hundred Peloponnesian hoplites
with three hundred Chalkidic peltasts; the commander of which
force, Polydamidas, took possession of the acropolis with his
own troops separately.<a id="FNanchor_703" href="#Footnote_703"
class="fnanchor">[703]</a> Brasidas then withdrew himself with the
greater part of his army, to accompany Perdikkas on an expedition
into the interior against Arrhibæus and the Lynkêstæ. On what ground,
after having before entered into terms with Arrhibæus, he now became
his active enemy, we are left to conjecture: probably his relations
with Perdikkas, whose alliance was of essential importance, were
such that this step was forced upon him against his will, or he may
really have thought that the force under Polydamidas was adequate
to the defence of Mendê and Skiônê; an idea which the unaccountable
backwardness of Athens for the last six or eight months might well
foster. Had he even remained, indeed, he could hardly have saved
them, considering the situation of Pallênê and the superiority
of Athens at sea; but his absence made their ruin certain.<a
id="FNanchor_704" href="#Footnote_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a></p>

<p>While Brasidas was thus engaged far in the interior, the
Athenian armament under Nikias and Nikostratus reached Potidæa:
fifty triremes, ten of them Chian; one thousand hoplites and six
hundred bowmen from Athens; one thousand mercenary Thracians, with
some peltasts from Methônê and other towns in the neighborhood.
From Potidæa, they proceeded by sea to Cape Poseidonium, near which
they landed for the purpose of attacking Mendê. Polydamidas, the
Peloponnesian commander in the town, took post with his force of
seven hundred hoplites, including three hundred Skiônæans, upon
an eminence near the city, strong and difficult of approach: upon
which the Athenian generals divided their forces; Nikias, with
sixty Athenian chosen hoplites, one hundred and twenty Methonean
peltasts, and all the bowmen, tried to march up the hill by a side
path and thus turn the position; while Nikostratus with the main
army attacked it in front. But such were the extreme difficulties
of the ground that both were repulsed: Nikias was himself wounded,
and the division of Nikostratus was thrown into great disorder,
narrowly escaping a destructive defeat. The Mendæans, however,
evacuated the position in the night and retired into the city; while
the Athe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_441">[p. 441]</span>nians,
sailing round on the morrow to the suburb on the side of Skiônê,
ravaged the neighboring lands; and Nikias on the ensuing day carried
his devastations still farther, even to the border of the Skiônæan
territory.</p>

<p>But dissensions had already commenced within the walls, and the
Skiônæan auxiliaries, becoming mistrustful of their situation, took
advantage of the night to return home. The revolt of Mendê had been
brought about against the will of the citizens by the intrigues and
for the benefit of an oligarchical faction: moreover, it does not
appear that Brasidas personally visited the town, as he had visited
Skiônê and the other revolted towns: had he come, his personal
influence might have done much to soothe the offended citizens, and
create some disposition to adopt the revolt as a fact accomplished,
after they had once been compromised with Athens. But his animating
words had not been heard, and the Peloponnesian troops whom he had
sent to Mendê, were mere instruments to sustain the newly erected
oligarchy and keep out the Athenians. The feelings of the citizens
generally towards them were soon unequivocally displayed. Nikostratus
with half of the Athenian force was planted before that gate of
Mendê which opened towards Potidæa: in the neighborhood of that
gate, within the city, was the place of arms and the chief station
both of the Peloponnesians and of the citizens; and Polydamidas,
intending to make a sally forth, was marshalling both of them in
battle order, when one of the Mendæan Demos, manifesting with angry
vehemence a sentiment common to most of them, told him, “that he
would not sally forth, and did not choose to take part in the
contest.” Polydamidas seized hold of the man to punish him, when
the mass of the armed Demos, taking part with their comrade, made
a sudden rush upon the Peloponnesians. The latter, unprepared for
such an onset, sustained at first some loss, and were soon forced
to retreat into the acropolis; the rather, as they saw some of the
Mendæans open the gates to the besiegers without, which induced
them to suspect a preconcerted betrayal. No such concert, however,
existed, though the besieging generals, when they saw the gates thus
suddenly opened, soon comprehended the real position of affairs.
But they found it impossible to restrain their soldiers, who pushed
in forthwith, from plunder<span class="pagenum" id="Page_442">[p.
442]</span>ing the town; and they had even some difficulty in saving
the lives of the citizens.<a id="FNanchor_705" href="#Footnote_705"
class="fnanchor">[705]</a></p>

<p>Mendê being thus taken, the Athenian generals desired the body
of the citizens to resume their former government, leaving it to
them to single out and punish the authors of the late revolt. What
use was made of this permission, we are not told; but probably most
of the authors had already escaped into the acropolis along with
Polydamidas. Having erected a wall of circumvallation round the
acropolis, joining the sea at both ends, and left a force to guard
it, the Athenians moved away to begin the siege of Skiônê, where
they found both the citizens and the Peloponnesian garrison posted
on a strong hill, not far from the walls. As it was impossible to
surround the town without being masters of this hill, the Athenians
attacked it at once, and were more fortunate than they had been
before Mendê; for they carried it by assault, compelling the
defenders to take refuge in the town. After erecting their trophy,
they commenced the wall of circumvallation. Before it was finished,
the garrison who had been shut up in the acropolis of Mendê, got
into Skiônê at night, having broken out by a sudden sally where the
blockading wall around them joined the sea. But this did not hinder
Nikias from prosecuting his operations, so that Skiônê was in no
long time completely inclosed, and a division placed to guard the
wall of circumvallation.<a id="FNanchor_706" href="#Footnote_706"
class="fnanchor">[706]</a></p>

<p>Such was the state of affairs which Brasidas found on returning
from the inland Macedonia. Unable either to recover Mendê or to
relieve Skiônê, he was forced to confine himself to the protection
of Torônê. Nikias, however, without attacking Torônê, returned
soon afterwards with his armament to Athens, leaving Skiônê under
blockade.</p>

<p>The march of Brasidas into Macedonia had been unfortunate in
every way, and nothing but his extraordinary gallantry rescued him
from utter ruin. The joint force of himself and Perdikkas consisted
of three thousand Grecian hoplites, Peloponnesian, Akanthian, and
Chalkidian, with one thousand Macedonian and Chalkidian horse, and a
considerable number of non-Hellenic auxiliaries. As soon as they had
got beyond the mountain-pass<span class="pagenum" id="Page_443">[p.
443]</span> into the territory of the Lynkêstæ, they were met by
Arrhibæus, and a battle ensued, in which that prince was completely
worsted. They halted here for a few days, awaiting—before they pushed
forward to attack the villages in the territory of Arrhibæus—the
arrival of a body of Illyrian mercenaries, with whom Perdikkas
had concluded a bargain.<a id="FNanchor_707" href="#Footnote_707"
class="fnanchor">[707]</a> At length Perdikkas became impatient to
advance without them; while Brasidas, on the contrary, apprehensive
for the fate of Mendê during his absence, was bent on returning back.
The dissension between them becoming aggravated, they parted company
and occupied separate encampments at some distance from each other,
when both received unexpected intelligence which made Perdikkas as
anxious to retreat as Brasidas. The Illyrians, having broken their
compact, had joined Arrhibæus, and were now in full march to attack
the invaders. The untold number of these barbarians was reported as
overwhelming, and such was their reputation for ferocity as well
as for valor, that the Macedonian army of Perdikkas, seized with a
sudden panic, broke up in the night and fled without orders, hurrying
Perdikkas himself along with them, and not even sending notice to
Brasidas, with whom nothing had been concerted about the retreat. In
the morning, the latter found Arrhibæus and the Illyrians close upon
him, while the Macedonians were already far advanced in their journey
homeward.</p>

<p>The contrast between the man of Hellas and of Macedonia, general
as well as soldiers, was never more strikingly exhibited than on this
critical occasion. The soldiers of Brasidas, though surprised as
well as deserted, lost neither their courage nor their discipline:
the commander preserved not only his presence of mind, but his full
authority. His hoplites were directed to form in a hollow square, or
oblong, with the light-armed and attendants in the centre, for the
retreating march: youthful soldiers were posted either in the outer
ranks, or in convenient stations, to run out swiftly and repel the
assailing enemy; while Brasidas himself, with three hundred chosen
men, formed the rear-guard.<a id="FNanchor_708" href="#Footnote_708"
class="fnanchor">[708]</a></p>

<p>The short harangue which, according to a custom universal with
Grecian generals, he addressed to his troops immediately before
the enemy approached, is in many respects remarkable.<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_444">[p. 444]</span> Though some were
Akanthians, some Chalkidians, some Helots, he designates all by the
honorable title of “Peloponnesians.” Reassuring them against the
desertion of their allies, as well as against the superior numbers
of the advancing enemy, he invokes their native, homebred courage.<a
id="FNanchor_709" href="#Footnote_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a>
“<i>Ye</i> do not require the presence of allies to inspire you with
bravery, nor do ye fear superior numbers of an enemy; for ye belong
not to those political communities in which the larger number
governs the smaller, but to those in which a few men rule subjects
more numerous than themselves, having acquired their power by no
other means than by superiority in battle.” Next, Brasidas tried to
dissipate the <i>prestige</i> of the Illyrian name; his army had already
vanquished the Lynkêstæ, and these other barbarians were noway
better. A nearer acquaintance would soon show that they were only
formidable from the noise, the gestures, the clashing of arms, and
the accompaniments of their onset; and that they were incapable of
sustaining the reality of close combat, hand to hand. “They have
no regular order (said he) such as to impress them with shame for
deserting their post: flight and attack are with them in equally
honorable esteem, so that there is nothing to test the really
courageous man: their battle, wherein every man fights as he chooses,
is just the thing to furnish each with a decent pretence for running
away.” “Repel ye their onset whenever it comes; and so soon as
opportunity offers, resume your retreat in rank and order. Ye will
soon arrive in a place of safety; and ye will be convinced that such
crowds, when their enemy has stood to defy the first onset, keep
aloof with empty menace and a parade of courage which never strikes;
while if their enemy gives way, they show themselves smart and bold
in running after him where there is no danger.”<a id="FNanchor_710"
href="#Footnote_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_445">[p. 445]</span></p>

<p>The superiority of disciplined and regimented force over
disorderly numbers, even with equal undivided courage, is now a
truth so familiar, that we require an effort of imagination to put
ourselves back into the fifth century before the Christian era, when
this truth was recognized only among the Hellenic communities; when
the practice of all their neighbors—Illyrians, Thracians, Asiatics,
Epirots, and even Macedonians—implied ignorance or contradiction of
it. In respect to the Epirots, the difference between their military
habits and those of the Greeks has been already noticed, having been
pointedly manifested in the memorable joint attack on the Akarnanian
town of Stratus, in the second year of the war.<a id="FNanchor_711"
href="#Footnote_711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a> Both Epirots and
Macedonians, however, are a step nearer to the Greeks than either
Thracians, or these Illyrian barbarians against whom Brasidas was now
about to contend, and in whose case the contrast comes out yet more
forcibly. Nor is it merely the contrast between two modes of fighting
which the Lacedæmonian commander impresses upon his soldiers: he
gives what may be called a moral theory of the principles on which
that contrast is founded,—a theory of large range and going to
the basis of Grecian social life, in peace as well as in war. The
sentiment in each individual man’s bosom,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_446">[p. 446]</span> of a certain place which he has to
fill and duties which he has to perform, combined with fear of the
displeasure of his neighbors as well as of his own self-reproach
if he shrinks back, but at the same time essentially bound up
and reciprocating with the feeling that his neighbors are under
corresponding obligations towards him,—this sentiment, which Brasidas
invokes as the settled military creed of his soldiers in their ranks,
was not less the regulating principle of their intercourse in peace
as citizens of the same community. Simple as this principle may seem,
it would have found no response in the army of Xerxes, or of the
Thracian Sitalkês, or of the Gaul Brennus. The Persian soldier rushes
to death by order of the Great King, perhaps under terror of a whip
which the Great King commands to be administered to him: the Illyrian
or the Gaul scorns such a stimulus, and obeys only the instigation of
his own pugnacity, or vengeance, or love of blood, or love of booty,
but recedes as soon as that individual sentiment is either satisfied
or overcome by fear. It is the Greek soldier alone who feels himself
bound to his comrades by ties reciprocal and indissoluble,<a
id="FNanchor_712" href="#Footnote_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a>—who
obeys neither the will of a king, nor his own individual impulse, but
a common and imperative sentiment of obligation,—whose honor or shame
is attached to his own place in the ranks, never to be abandoned nor
overstepped. Such conceptions of military duty, established in the
minds of these soldiers whom Brasidas addressed, will come to be
farther illustrated when we describe the memorable Retreat of the
Ten Thousand: at present, I merely indicate them as forming a part
of that general scheme of morality, social and political as well as
military, wherein the Greeks stood exalted above the nations who
surrounded them.</p>

<p>But there is another point in the speech of Brasidas which
deserves notice. He tells his soldiers: “Courage is your homebred
property; for ye belong to communities wherein the small<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_447">[p. 447]</span> number governs
the larger, simply by reason of superior prowess in themselves
and conquest by their ancestors.” First, it is remarkable that
a large proportion of the Peloponnesian soldiers, whom Brasidas
thus addresses, consisted of Helots, the conquered race, not the
conquerors: yet so easily does the military or regimental pride
supplant the sympathies of race, that these men would feel flattered
by being addressed as if they were themselves sprung from the race
which had enslaved their ancestors. Next, we here see the right of
the strongest invoked as the legitimate source of power, and as
an honorable and ennobling recollection, by an officer of Dorian
race, oligarchical politics, unperverted intellect, and estimable
character: and we shall accordingly be prepared, when we find a
similar principle hereafter laid down by the Athenian envoys at
Melos, to disallow the explanation of those who treat it merely as
a theory invented by demagogues and sophists, upon one or other of
whom it is common to throw the blame of all that is objectionable in
Grecian politics or morality.</p>

<p>Having finished his harangue, Brasidas gave orders for retreat.
As soon as his march began, the Illyrians rushed upon him with
all the confidence and shouts of pursuers against a flying enemy,
believing that they should completely destroy his army. But wherever
they approached near, the young soldiers specially stationed for
the purpose, turned upon and beat them back with severe loss; while
Brasidas himself, with his rear-guard of three hundred, was present
everywhere rendering vigorous aid. When the Lynkêstæ and Illyrians
attacked, the army halted and repelled them, after which it resumed
its retreating march. The barbarians found themselves so rudely
handled, and with such unwonted vigor,—for they probably had had
no previous experience of Grecian troops,—that after a few trials
they desisted from meddling with the army in its retreat along the
plain. They ran forward rapidly, partly in order to overtake the
Macedonians under Perdikkas, who had fled before, partly to occupy
the narrow pass, with high hills on each side, which formed the
entrance into Lynkêstis, and which lay in the road of Brasidas.
When the latter approached this narrow pass, he saw the barbarians
masters of it; several of them were already on the summits, and
more were ascending to reinforce them; while a portion of<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_448">[p. 448]</span> them were moving down
upon his rear. Brasidas immediately gave orders to his chosen three
hundred, to charge up the most assailable of the two hills, with
their best speed, before it became more numerously occupied, not
staying to preserve compact ranks. This unexpected and vigorous
movement disconcerted the barbarians, who fled, abandoning the
eminence to the Greeks, and leaving their own men in the pass exposed
on one of their flanks.<a id="FNanchor_713" href="#Footnote_713"
class="fnanchor">[713]</a> The retreating army, thus master of one
of the side hills, was enabled to force its way through the middle
pass, and to drive away the Lynkêstian and Illyrian occupants. Having
got through this narrow outlet, Brasidas found himself on the higher
ground, nor did his enemies dare to attack him farther: so that he
was enabled to reach, even in that day’s march, the first town or
village in the kingdom of Perdikkas, called Arnissa. So incensed
were his soldiers with the Macedonian subjects of Perdikkas, who had
fled on the first news of danger without giving them any notice,
that they seized and appropriated all the articles of baggage,
not inconsiderable in number, which happened to have been dropped
in the disorder of a nocturnal flight; and they even unharnessed
and slew the oxen out of the baggage carts.<a id="FNanchor_714"
href="#Footnote_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a></p>

<p>Perdikkas keenly resented this behavior of the troops of
Brasidas, following as it did immediately upon his own quarrel
with that general, and upon the mortification of his repulse from
Lynkêstis. From this moment he broke off his alliance with the
Peloponnesians, and opened negotiations with Nikias, then engaged
in constructing the wall of blockade round Skiônê. Such was the
general faithlessness of this prince, however, that Nikias<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_449">[p. 449]</span> required as a
condition of the alliance, some manifest proof of the sincerity of
his intentions; and Perdikkas was soon enabled to afford a proof of
considerable importance.<a id="FNanchor_715" href="#Footnote_715"
class="fnanchor">[715]</a></p>

<p>The relations between Athens and Peloponnesus, since the
conclusion of the truce in the preceding March, had settled into
a curious combination. In Thrace, war was prosecuted by mutual
understanding, and with unabated vigor; but everywhere else the
truce was observed. The main purpose of the truce, however, that of
giving time for discussions preliminary to a definitive peace, was
completely frustrated; nor does the decree of the Athenian people,
which stands included in their vote sanctioning the truce, for
sending and receiving envoys to negotiate such a peace, ever seem to
have been executed.</p>

<p>Instead of this, the Lacedæmonians despatched a considerable
reinforcement by land to join Brasidas; probably at his own
request, and also instigated by hearing of the Athenian armament
now under Nikias in Pallênê. But Ischagoras, the commander of the
reinforcement, on reaching the borders of Thessaly, found all
farther progress impracticable, and was compelled to send back his
troops. For Perdikkas, by whose powerful influence alone Brasidas
had been enabled to pass through Thessaly, now directed his
Thessalian guests to keep the new-comers off; which was far more
easily executed, and was gratifying to the feelings of Perdikkas
himself, as well as an essential service to the Athenians.<a
id="FNanchor_716" href="#Footnote_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a>
Ischagoras, however, with a few companions, but without his army,
made his way to Brasidas, having been particularly directed by the
Lacedæmonians to inspect and report upon the state of affairs. He
numbered among his companions a few select Spartans of the military
age, intended to be placed as harmosts or governors in the cities
reduced by Brasidas: this was among the first violations, apparently
often repeated afterwards, of the ancient Spartan custom, that none
except elderly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_450">[p. 450]</span>
men, above the military age, should be named to such posts. Indeed,
Brasidas himself was an illustrious departure from the ancient rule.
The mission of these officers was intended to guard against the
appointment of any but Spartans to such posts, for there were no
Spartans in the army of Brasidas. One of the new-comers, Klearidas,
was made governor of Amphipolis; another, Pasitelidas, of Torônê.<a
id="FNanchor_717" href="#Footnote_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a> It
is probable that these inspecting commissioners may have contributed
to fetter the activity of Brasidas: and the newly-declared hostility
of Perdikkas, together with disappointment in the non-arrival of
the fresh troops intended to join him, much abridged his means. We
hear of only one exploit performed by him at this time, and that too
more than six months after the retreat from Macedonia, about January
or February 422 <small>B.C.</small> Having established
intelligence with some parties in the town of Potidæa, in the view
of surprising it, he contrived to bring up his army in the night
to the foot of the walls, and even to plant his scaling ladders,
without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_451">[p. 451]</span> being
discovered. The sentinel carrying and ringing the bell had just
passed by on the wall, leaving for a short interval an unguarded
space (the practice apparently being, to pass this bell round along
the walls from one sentinel to another throughout the night), when
some of the soldiers of Brasidas took advantage of the moment to
try and mount. But before they could reach the top of the wall,
the sentinel came back, alarm was given, and the assailants were
compelled to retreat.<a id="FNanchor_718" href="#Footnote_718"
class="fnanchor">[718]</a></p>

<p>In the absence of actual war between the ascendent powers in and
near Peloponnesus, during the course of this summer, Thucydidês
mentions to us some incidents which perhaps he would have omitted had
there been great warlike operations to describe. The great temple of
Hêrê, between Mykenæ and Argos (nearer to the former, and in early
times more intimately connected with it, but now an appendage of the
latter, Mykenæ itself having been subjected and almost depopulated
by the Argeians), enjoyed an ancient Pan-Hellenic reputation; the
catalogue of its priestesses, seemingly with a statue or bust of
each, was preserved or imagined through centuries of past time, real
and mythical, beginning with the goddess herself or her immediate
nominees. Chrysis, an old woman, who had been priestess there for
fifty-six years, happened to fall asleep in the temple with a burning
lamp near to her head: the fillet encircling her head took fire, and
though she herself escaped unhurt, the temple itself, very ancient,
and perhaps built of wood, was consumed. From fear of the wrath of
the Argeians, Chrysis fled to Phlius, and subsequently thought it
necessary to seek protection as a suppliant in the temple of Athênê
Alea, at Tegea: Phaeinis was appointed priestess in her place.<a
id="FNanchor_719" href="#Footnote_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a>
The temple was rebuilt on an adjoining spot by<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_452">[p. 452]</span> Eupolemus, of Argos, continuing as
much as possible the antiquities and traditions of the former, but
with greater splendor and magnitude: Pausanias, the traveller,
who describes this temple as a visitor, near six hundred years
afterwards, saw near it the remnant of the old temple which had been
burned.</p>

<p>We hear farther of a war in Arcadia, between the two important
cities of Mantineia and Tegea, each attended by its Arcadian allies,
partly free, partly subject. In a battle fought between them at
Laodikion, the victory was disputed: each party erected a trophy,
each sent spoils to the temple of Delphi. We shall have occasion soon
to speak farther of these Arcadian dissensions.</p>

<p>The Bœotians had been no parties to the truce sworn between
Sparta and Athens in the preceding month of March; but they seem to
have followed the example of Sparta in abstaining from hostilities
<i>de facto</i>: and we may conclude that they acceded to the request
of Sparta so far as to allow the transit of Athenian visitors and
sacred envoys through Bœotia to the Delphian temple. The only actual
incident which we hear of in Bœotia during this interval, is one
which illustrates forcibly the harsh and ungenerous ascendency of
the Thebans over the inferior Bœotian cities.<a id="FNanchor_720"
href="#Footnote_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a> The Thebans destroyed
the walls of Thespiæ, and condemned the city to remain unfortified,
on the charge of <i>atticizing</i> tendencies. How far this suspicion
was well founded we have no means of judging: but the Thespians,
far from being dangerous at this moment, were altogether helpless,
having lost the flower of their military force at the battle of
Delium, where their station was on the defeated wing. It was this
very helplessness, brought upon them by their services to Thebes
against Athens, which now both impelled and enabled the Thebans to
enforce the rigorous sentence above mentioned.<a id="FNanchor_721"
href="#Footnote_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_453">[p. 453]</span></p>

<p>But the month of March, or the Attic Elaphebolion, 422
<small>B.C.</small>, the time prescribed for expiration of the one
year’s truce, had now arrived. It has already been mentioned that
this truce had never been more than partially observed: Brasidas
in Thrace had disregarded it from the beginning, and both the
contracting powers had tacitly acquiesced in the anomalous condition,
of war in Thrace coupled with peace elsewhere. Either of them had
thus an excellent pretext for breaking the truce altogether; and as
neither acted upon this pretext, we plainly see that the paramount
feeling and ascendent parties, among both, tended to peace of their
own accord, at that time. Nor was there anything except the interest
of Brasidas, and of those revolted subjects of Athens to whom he
had bound himself, which kept alive the war in Thrace. Under such a
state of feeling, the oath taken to maintain the truce still seemed
imperative on both parties, always excepting Thracian affairs.
Moreover, the Athenians were to a certain degree soothed by their
success at Mendê and Skiônê, and by their acquisition of Perdikkas as
an ally, during the summer and autumn of 423 <small>B.C.</small> But
the state of sentiment between the contracting parties was not such
as to make it possible to treat for any longer peace, or to conclude
any new agreement, though neither were disposed to depart from that
which had been already concluded.</p>

<p>The mere occurrence of the last day of the truce made no practical
difference at first in this condition of things. The truce had
expired: either party might renew hostilities; but neither actually
did renew them. To the Athenians, there was this additional motive
for abstaining from hostilities for a few months longer: the
great Pythian festival would be celebrated at Delphi in July or
the beginning of August, and as they had been excluded from that
holy spot during all the interval between the beginning of the war
and the conclusion of the one year’s truce, their pious feelings
seem now to have taken a peculiar longing towards the visits,
pilgrimages, and festivals connected with it. Though the truce,
therefore, had really ceased, no actual warfare took place until the
Pythian games were over.<a id="FNanchor_722" href="#Footnote_722"
class="fnanchor">[722]</a></p> <p><span class="pagenum"
id="Page_454">[p. 454]</span></p> <p>But though the actions of
Athens remained unaltered, the talk at Athens became very different.
Kleon and his supporters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_455">[p.
455]</span> renewed their instances to obtain a vigorous prosecution
of the war, and renewed them with great additional strength of
argument; the question being now open to considerations of political
prudence, without any binding obligation.</p>

<p>“At this time (observes Thucydidês)<a id="FNanchor_723"
href="#Footnote_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a> the great enemies
of peace were, Brasidas on one side, and Kleon on the other: the
former, because he was in full success and rendered illustrious by
the war; the latter, because he thought that if peace were concluded,
he should be detected in his dishonest politics, and be less easily
credited in his criminations of others.” As to Brasidas, the remark
of the historian is indisputable: it would be wonderful, indeed,
if he, in whom so many splendid qualities were brought out by the
war, and who had moreover contracted obligations with the Thracian
towns which gave him hopes and fears of his own, entirely apart from
Lacedæmon,—it would be wonderful if the war and its continuance were
not in his view the paramount object. In truth, his position in
Thrace constituted an insurmountable obstacle to any solid or steady
peace, independently of the dispositions of Kleon.</p>

<p>But the coloring which Thucydidês gives to Kleon’s support of the
war is open to much greater comment. First, we may well raise the
question, whether Kleon had any real interest in war,—whether his
personal or party consequence in the city was at all enhanced by
it. He had himself no talent or competence for warlike operations,
which tended infallibly to place ascendency in the hands of others,
and to throw him into the shade. As to his power of carrying on
dishonest intrigues with success, that must depend on the extent of
his political ascendency; while matter of crimination against others,
assuming him to be careless of truth or falsehood, could hardly
be wanting either in war or peace; and if the war brought forward
unsuc<span class="pagenum" id="Page_456">[p. 456]</span>cessful
generals open to his accusations, it would also throw up successful
generals who would certainly outshine him, and would probably put
him down. In the life which Plutarch has given us of Phokion, a
plain and straightforward military man, we read that one of the
frequent and criminative speakers of Athens, of character analogous
to that which is ascribed to Kleon, expressed his surprise on
hearing Phokion dissuade the Athenians from embarking in a new war:
“Yes (said Phokion), I think it right to dissuade them; though I
know well, that if there be war, I shall have command over you; if
there be peace, you will have command over me.”<a id="FNanchor_724"
href="#Footnote_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a> This is surely
a more rational estimate of the way in which war affects the
comparative importance of the orator and the military officer, than
that which Thucydidês pronounces in reference to the interests of
Kleon. Moreover, when we come to follow the political history of
Syracuse, we shall find the demagogue Athenagoras ultra-pacific, and
the aristocrat Hermokratês far more warlike:<a id="FNanchor_725"
href="#Footnote_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a> the former is afraid,
not without reason, that war will raise into consequence energetic
military leaders dangerous to the popular constitution. We may add,
that Kleon himself had not been always warlike: he commenced his
political career as an opponent of Periklês, when the latter was
strenuously maintaining the necessity and prudence of beginning
the Peloponnesian war.<a id="FNanchor_726" href="#Footnote_726"
class="fnanchor">[726]</a></p>

<p>But farther, if we should even grant that Kleon had a separate
party-interest in promoting the war, it will still remain to be
considered, whether, at this particular crisis, the employment of
energetic warlike measures in Thrace was not really the sound and
prudent policy for Athens. Taking Periklês as the best judge of
that policy, we shall find him at the outset of the war inculcating
emphatically two important points: 1. To stand vigorously upon the
defensive, maintaining unimpaired their maritime empire, “keeping
their subject-allies well in hand,” submitting patiently even to
see Attica ravaged. 2. To abstain from trying to enlarge their
empire or to make new conquests during the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_457">[p. 457]</span> war.<a id="FNanchor_727"
href="#Footnote_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a> Consistently with
this well-defined plan of action, Periklês, had he lived, would
have taken care to interfere vigorously and betimes to prevent
Brasidas from making his conquests: had such interference been
either impossible or accidentally frustrated, he would have thought
no efforts too great to recover them. To maintain undiminished the
integrity of the empire, as well as that impression of Athenian force
upon which the empire rested, was his cardinal principle. Now it is
impossible to deny that in reference to Thrace, Kleon adhered more
closely than his rival Nikias to the policy of Periklês. It was to
Nikias, more than to Kleon, that the fatal mistake made by Athens in
not interfering speedily after Brasidas first broke into Thrace is
to be imputed: it was Nikias and his partisans, desirous of peace at
almost any price, and knowing that the Lacedæmonians also desired it,
who encouraged his countrymen, at a moment of great public depression
of spirit, to leave Brasidas unopposed in Thrace, and rely on the
chance of negotiation with Sparta for arresting his progress. The
peace-party at Athens carried their point of the truce for a year,
with the promise and for the express purpose of checking the farther
conquests of Brasidas; also with the farther promise of maturing that
truce into a permanent peace, and obtaining under the peace even the
restoration of Amphipolis.</p>

<p>Such was the policy of Nikias and his party, the friends
of peace and opponents of Kleon. And the promises which they
thus held out might perhaps appear plausible in March 422 <small>B.C.</small>, at the moment when the truce for one
year was concluded. But the subsequent events had frustrated them
in the most glaring manner, and had even shown the best reason for
believing that no such expectations could possibly be realized while
Brasidas was in unbroken and unopposed action. For the Lacedæmonians,
though seemingly sincere in concluding the truce on the basis of
<i>uti possidetis</i>, and desiring to extend it to Thrace as well as
elsewhere, had been unable to enforce the observance of it upon
Brasidas, or to restrain him even from making new acquisitions,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_458">[p. 458]</span> so that Athens never
obtained the benefit of the truce, exactly in that region where she
most stood in need of it. Only by the despatch of her armament to
Skiônê and Mendê had she maintained herself in possession even of
Pallênê. Now what was the lesson to be derived from this experience,
when the Athenians came to discuss their future policy, after the
truce was at an end? The great object of all parties at Athens was
to recover the lost possessions in Thrace, especially Amphipolis.
Nikias, still urging negotiations for peace, continued to hold out
hopes that the Lacedæmonians would be willing to restore that place,
as the price of their captives now at Athens; and his connection
with Sparta would enable him to announce her professions even upon
authority. But to this Kleon might make, and doubtless did make, a
complete reply, grounded upon the most recent experience: “If the
Lacedæmonians consent to the restitution of Amphipolis (he would
say), it will probably be only with the view of finding some means
to escape performance, and yet to get back their prisoners. But
granting that they are perfectly sincere, they will never be able to
control Brasidas, and those parties in Thrace who are bound up with
him by community of feeling and interest; so that after all, you will
give them back their prisoners on the faith of an equivalent beyond
their power to realize. Look at what has happened during the truce!
So different are the views and obligations of Brasidas in Thrace
from those of the Lacedæmonians, that he would not even obey their
order when they directed him to stand as he was, and to desist from
farther conquest: much less will he obey them when they direct him
to surrender what he has already got: least of all, if they enjoin
the surrender of Amphipolis, his grand acquisition and his central
point for all future effort. Depend upon it, if you desire to regain
Amphipolis, you will only regain it by energetic employment of force,
as has happened with Skiônê and Mendê: and you ought to put forth
your strength for this purpose immediately, while the Lacedæmonian
prisoners are yet in your hands, instead of waiting until after you
shall have been deluded into giving them up, thereby losing all your
hold upon Lacedæmon.”</p>

<p>Such anticipations were fully verified by the result: for
subsequent history will show that the Lacedæmonians, when they had
bound themselves by treaty to give up Amphipolis, either would<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_459">[p. 459]</span> not, or could not,
enforce performance of their stipulation, even after the death of
Brasidas: much less could they have done so during his life, when
there was his great personal influence, strenuous will, and hopes
of future conquest, to serve as increased obstruction to them. Such
anticipations were also plainly suggested by the recent past: so that
in putting them into the mouth of Kleon, we are only supposing him to
read the lesson open before his eyes.</p>

<p>Now since the war-policy of Kleon, taken at this moment after
the expiration of the one year’s truce, may be thus shown to be not
only more conformable to the genius of Periklês, but also founded
on a juster estimate of events both past and future, than the
peace-policy of Nikias, what are we to say to the historian, who,
without refuting such presumptions, every one of which is deduced
from his own narrative, nay, without even indicating their existence,
merely tells us that “Kleon opposed the peace in order that he might
cloke dishonest intrigues and find matter for plausible crimination?”
We cannot but say of this criticism, with profound regret that such
words must be pronounced respecting any judgment of Thucydidês, that
it is harsh and unfair towards Kleon, and careless in regard to truth
and the instruction of his readers. It breathes not that same spirit
of honorable impartiality which pervades his general history: it is
an interpolation by the officer whose improvidence had occasioned to
his countrymen the fatal loss of Amphipolis, retaliating upon the
citizen who justly accused him: it is conceived in the same tone as
his unaccountable judgment in the matter of Sphakteria.</p>

<p>Rejecting on this occasion the judgment of Thucydidês, we may
confidently affirm that Kleon had rational public grounds for urging
his countrymen to undertake with energy the reconquest of Amphipolis.
Demagogue and leather-seller though he was, he stands here honorably
distinguished, as well from the tameness and inaction of Nikias,
who grasped at peace with hasty credulity through sickness of the
efforts of war, as from the restless movement and novelties, not
merely unprofitable but ruinous, which we shall presently find
springing up under the auspices of Alkibiadês. Periklês had said to
his countrymen, at a time when they were enduring all the miseries of
pestilence, and were in a state of despondency even greater than that
which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_460">[p. 460]</span> prevailed
in <small>B.C.</small> 422: “You hold your empire and
your proud position, by the condition of being willing to encounter
cost, fatigue, and danger: abstain from all views of enlarging the
empire, but think no effort too great to maintain it unimpaired.
To lose what we have once got is more disgraceful than to fail in
attempts at acquisition.”<a id="FNanchor_728" href="#Footnote_728"
class="fnanchor">[728]</a> The very same language was probably held
by Kleon when exhorting his countrymen to an expedition for the
reconquest of Amphipolis. But when uttered by him, it would have
a very different effect from that which it had formerly produced
when held by Periklês, and different also from that which it would
now have produced if held by Nikias. The entire peace-party would
repudiate it when it came from Kleon; partly out of dislike to the
speaker, partly from a conviction, doubtless felt by every one, that
an expedition against Brasidas would be a hazardous and painful
service to all concerned in it, general as well as soldiers; partly
also from a persuasion, sincerely entertained at the time, though
afterwards proved to be illusory by the result, that Amphipolis might
really be got back through peace with the Lacedæmonians.</p>

<p>If Kleon, in proposing the expedition, originally proposed himself
as the commander, a new ground of objection, and a very forcible
ground, would thus be furnished. Since everything which Kleon does is
understood to be a manifestation of some vicious or silly attribute,
we are told that this was an instance of his absurd presumption,
arising out of the success of Pylus, and persuading him that he was
the only general who could put down Brasidas. But if the success at
Pylus had really filled him with such overweening military conceit,
it is most unaccountable that he should not have procured for himself
some command during the year which immediately succeeded the affair
at Sphakteria, the eighth year of the war: a season of most active
warlike enterprise, when his presumption and influence arising out of
the Sphakterian victory must have been fresh and glowing. As he<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_461">[p. 461]</span> obtained no command
during this immediately succeeding period we may fairly doubt whether
he ever really conceived such excessive personal presumption of his
own talents for war, and whether he did not retain after the affair
of Sphakteria the same character which he had manifested in that
affair, reluctance to engage in military expeditions himself, and a
disposition to see them commanded as well as carried on by others.
It is by no means certain that Kleon, in proposing the expedition
against Amphipolis, originally proposed to take the command of it
himself: I think it at least equally probable, that his original
wish was to induce Nikias or the stratêgi to take the command of
it, as in the case of Sphakteria. Nikias, doubtless, opposed the
expedition as much as he could: when it was determined by the people,
in spite of his opposition, he would peremptorily decline the command
for himself, and would do all he could to force it upon Kleon, or
at least would be better pleased to see it under his command than
under that of any one else. He would be not less glad to exonerate
himself from a dangerous service than to see his rival entangled in
it; and he would have before him the same alternative which he and
his friends had contemplated with so much satisfaction in the affair
of Sphakteria: either the expedition would succeed, in which case
Amphipolis would be taken, or it would fail, and the consequence
would be the ruin of Kleon. The last of the two was really the more
probable at Amphipolis, as Nikias had erroneously imagined it to be
at Sphakteria.</p>

<p>It is easy to see, however, that an expedition proposed under
these circumstances by Kleon, though it might command a majority in
the public assembly, would have a large proportion of the citizens
unfavorable to it, and even wishing that it might fail. Moreover,
Kleon had neither talents nor experience for commanding an army,
and the being engaged under his command in fighting against the
ablest officer of the time, could inspire no confidence to any
man in putting on his armor. From all these circumstances united,
political as well as military, we are not surprised to hear that
the hoplites whom he took out with him went with much reluctance.<a
id="FNanchor_729" href="#Footnote_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a>
An ignorant general, with unwilling<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_462">[p. 462]</span> soldiers, many of them politically
disliking him, stood little chance of wresting Amphipolis from
Brasidas: but had Nikias or the stratêgi done their duty, and carried
the entire force of the city under competent command to the same
object, the issue would probably have been different as to gain and
loss; certainly very different as to dishonor.</p>

<p>Kleon started from Peiræus, apparently towards the beginning
of August, with twelve hundred Athenian, Lemnian, and Imbrian
hoplites, and three hundred horsemen, troops of excellent quality and
condition: besides an auxiliary force of allies, number not exactly
known, and thirty triremes. This armament was not of magnitude at all
equal to the taking of Amphipolis; for Brasidas had equal numbers,
besides all the advantages of the position. But it was a part of
the scheme of Kleon, on arriving at Eion, to procure Macedonian and
Thracian reinforcements before he commenced his attack. He first
halted in his voyage near Skiônê, from which place he took away
such of the hoplites as could be spared from the blockade. He next
sailed across the gulf from Pallênê to the Sithonian peninsula,
to a place called the Harbor of the Kolophonians, near Torônê.<a
id="FNanchor_730" href="#Footnote_730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a>
Having here learned that neither Brasidas himself, nor any
considerable Peloponnesian garrison were present in Torônê, he landed
his forces and marched to attack the town, sending ten triremes at
the same time round a promontory which separated the harbor of the
Kolophonians from Torônê, to assail the latter place from seaward. It
happened that Brasidas, desiring to enlarge the fortified circle of
Torônê, had broken down a portion of the old wall, and employed the
materials in building a new and larger wall inclosing the proasteion,
or suburb: this new wall appears to have been still incomplete
and in an imperfect state of defence. Pasi<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_463">[p. 463]</span>telidas, the Peloponnesian commander,
resisted the attack of the Athenians as long as he could; but when
already beginning to give way, he saw the ten Athenian triremes
sailing into the harbor, which was hardly guarded at all. Abandoning
the defence of the suburb, he hastened to repel these new assailants,
but came too late, so that the town was entered from both sides at
once. Brasidas, who was not far off, rendered aid with the utmost
celerity, but was yet at five miles’ distance from the city when
he learned the capture, and was obliged to retire unsuccessfully.
Pasitelidas the commander, with the Peloponnesian garrison and
the Torônæan male population, were despatched as prisoners to
Athens; while the Torônæan women and children, by a fate but too
common in those days, were sold as slaves.<a id="FNanchor_731"
href="#Footnote_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a></p>

<p>After this not unimportant success, Kleon sailed round the
promontory of Athos to Eion at the mouth of the Strymon, within three
miles of Amphipolis. From hence, in execution of his original scheme,
he sent envoys to Perdikkas, urging him to lend effective aid as the
ally of Athens in the attack of Amphipolis, with his whole forces;
and to Pollês the king of the Thracian Odomantes, inviting him also
to come with as many Thracian mercenaries as could be levied. The
Edonians, the Thracian tribe nearest to Amphipolis, took part with
Brasidas: and the local influence of the banished Thucydidês would
no longer be at the service of Athens, much less at the service of
Kleon. Awaiting the expected reinforcements, Kleon employed himself,
first in an attack upon Stageirus in the Strymonic gulf, which was
repulsed; next upon Galêpsus, on the coast opposite the island of
Thasos, which was successful. But the reinforcements did not at
once arrive, and being too weak to attack Amphipolis without them,
he was obliged to remain inactive at Eion; while Brasidas on his
side made no movement out of Amphipolis, but contented himself with
keeping constant watch over the forces of Kleon, the view of which he
commanded from his station on the hill of Kerdylion, on the western
bank of the river-communication with Amphipolis by the bridge.
Some days elapsed in such inaction on both sides; but the Athenian
hoplites, becoming impatient of doing nothing, soon began to give
vent to those feelings of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_464">[p.
464]</span> dislike which they had brought out from Athens against
their general, “whose ignorance and cowardice (says the historian)
they contrasted with the skill and bravery of his opponent.”<a
id="FNanchor_732" href="#Footnote_732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a>
Athenian hoplites, if they felt such a sentiment, were not likely
to refrain from manifesting it; and Kleon was presently made aware
of the fact in a manner sufficiently painful to force him against
his will into some movement; which, however, he did not intend to be
anything else than a march for the purpose of surveying the ground
all round the city, and a demonstration to escape the appearance of
doing nothing, being aware that it was impossible to attack the place
with any effect before his reinforcements arrived.</p>

<p>To comprehend the important incidents which followed, it is
necessary to say a few words on the topography of Amphipolis, as far
as we can understand it on the imperfect evidence before us. That
city was placed on the left bank of the Strymon, on a conspicuous
hill around which the river makes a bend, first in a southwesterly
direction, then, after a short course to the southward, back in a
southeasterly direction. Amphipolis had for its only artificial
fortification one long wall, which began near the point northeast
of the town, where the river narrows again into a channel, after
passing through the lake Kerkinitis, ascended along the eastern
side of the hill, crossing the ridge which connects it with Mount
Pangæus, and then descended so as to touch the river again at another
point south of the town; thus being, as it were, a string to the
highly-bent bow formed by the river. On three sides therefore, north,
west, and south, the city was defended only by the Strymon, and was
thus visible without any intervening wall to spectators from the
side of the sea (south), as well as from the side of the continent
(or west and north).<a id="FNanchor_733" href="#Footnote_733"
class="fnanchor">[733]</a> At some<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_465">[p. 465]</span> little distance below the point where
the wall touched the river south of the city, was the bridge,<a
id="FNanchor_734" href="#Footnote_734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a>
a communication of great importance for the whole country,
which connected the territory of Amphip<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_466">[p. 466]</span>olis with that of Argilus. On the
western or right bank of the river, bordering it, and forming an
outer bend corresponding to the bend of the river, was situated Mount
Kerdylium: in fact, the course of the Strymon is here determined by
these two steep eminences, Kerdylium on the west, and the hill of
Amphipolis on the east, between which it flows. At the time when
Brasidas first took the place, the bridge was totally unconnected
with the long city wall; but during the intervening eighteen months,
he had erected a palisade work—probably an earthen bank topped
with a palisade—connecting the two. By means of this palisade, the
bridge was thus at the time of Kleon’s expedition comprehended
within the fortifications of the city; and Brasidas, while keeping
watch on Mount Kerdylium, could pass over whenever he chose into
the city, without any fear of impediment.<a id="FNanchor_735"
href="#Footnote_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_467">[p. 467]</span></p>

<p>In the march which Kleon now undertook, he went up to the top of
the ridge which runs nearly in an easterly direction from Amphipolis
to Mount Pangæus, in order to survey the city and its adjoining
ground on the northern and northeastern side which he had not yet
seen; that is, the side towards the lake, and towards Thrace,<a
id="FNanchor_736" href="#Footnote_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a>
which was not visible from the lower ground near Eion. The road
which he was to take from Eion lay at a small distance eastward
of the city long wall, and from the palisade which connected that
wall with the bridge. But he had no expectation of being attacked
in his march, the rather as Brasidas with the larger portion of
his force was visible on Mount Kerdylium: moreover, the gates of
Amphipolis were all shut, not a man was on the wall, nor were any
symptoms<span class="pagenum" id="Page_468">[p. 468]</span> of
movement to be detected. As there was no evidence before him of
intention to attack, he took no precautions, and marched in careless
and disorderly array.<a id="FNanchor_737" href="#Footnote_737"
class="fnanchor">[737]</a> Having reached the top of the ridge,
and posted his army on the strong eminence fronting the highest
portion of the Long Wall, he surveyed at leisure the lake before
him, and the side of the city which lay towards Thrace, or towards
Myrkinus, Drabêskus, etc., thus viewing all the descending portion
of the Long Wall northward towards the Strymon. The perfect
quiescence of the city imposed upon and even astonished him: it
seemed altogether undefended, and he almost fancied that, if he
had brought battering-engines, he could have taken it forthwith.<a
id="FNanchor_738" href="#Footnote_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a>
Impressed with the belief that<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_469">[p. 469]</span> there was no enemy prepared to fight,
he took his time to survey the ground; while his soldiers became more
and more relaxed and careless in their trim, some even advancing
close up to the walls and gates.</p>

<p>But this state of affairs was soon materially changed. Brasidas
knew that the Athenian hoplites would not long endure the tedium
of absolute inaction, and he calculated that by affecting extreme
backwardness and apparent fear, he should seduce Kleon into some
incautious movement of which advantage might be taken. His station on
Mount Kerdylium enabled him to watch the march of the Athenian army
from Eion, and when he saw them pass up along the road outside of the
Long Wall of Amphipolis,<a id="FNanchor_739" href="#Footnote_739"
class="fnanchor">[739]</a> he immediately crossed the river with
his forces and entered the town. But it was not his intention to
march out and offer them open battle; for his army, though equal in
number to theirs, was extremely inferior in arms and equipment;<a
id="FNanchor_740" href="#Footnote_740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a>
in which points the Athenian force now present was so admirably
provided, that his own men would not think themselves a match for
it, if the two armies faced each other in open field. He relied
altogether on the effect of sudden sally and well-timed surprise,
when the Athenians should have been thrown into a feeling of
contemptuous security by an exaggerated show of impotence in their
enemy.</p>

<p>Having offered the battle sacrifice at the temple of Athênê,
Brasidas called his men together to address to them the usual
encouragements prior to an engagement. After appealing to the Dorian
pride of his Peloponnesians, accustomed to triumph over Ionians,
he explained to them his design of relying upon a bold and sudden
movement with comparatively small numbers, against the Athenian army
when not prepared for it,<a id="FNanchor_741" href="#Footnote_741"
class="fnanchor">[741]</a> when their courage<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_470">[p. 470]</span> was not wound up to battle pitch, and
when, after carelessly mounting the hill to survey the ground, they
were thinking only of quietly returning to quarters. He himself at
the proper moment would rush out from one gate, and be foremost in
conflict with the enemy: Klearidas, with that bravery which became
him as a Spartan, would follow the example by sallying out from
another gate: and the enemy, taken thus unawares, would probably make
little resistance. For the Amphipolitans, this day and their own
behavior would determine whether they were to be allies of Lacedæmon,
or slaves of Athens, perhaps sold into captivity or even put to death
as a punishment for their recent revolt.</p>

<p>These preparations, however, could not be completed in secrecy;
for Brasidas and his army were perfectly visible while descending
the hill of Kerdylium, crossing the bridge and entering Amphipolis,
to the Athenian scouts without: moreover, so conspicuous was the
interior of the city to spectators without, that the temple of
Athênê, and Brasidas with its ministers around him, performing the
ceremony of sacrifice, was distinctly recognized. The fact was made
known to Kleon as he stood on the high ridge taking his survey, while
at the same time those who had gone near to the gates reported that
the feet of many horses and men were beginning to be seen under them,
as if preparing for a sally.<a id="FNanchor_742" href="#Footnote_742"
class="fnanchor">[742]</a> He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_471">[p.
471]</span> himself went close to the gate, and satisfied himself of
this circumstance: we must recollect that there was no defender on
the walls, and no danger from missiles. Anxious to avoid coming to
any real engagement before his reinforcements should arrive, he at
once gave orders for retreat, which he thought might be accomplished
before the attack from within could be fully organized; for he
imagined that a considerable number of troops would be marched out,
and ranged in battle order, before the attack was actually begun,
not dreaming that the sally would be instantaneous, made with a mere
handful of men. Orders having been proclaimed to wheel to the left,
and retreat in column on the left flank towards Eion, Kleon, who was
himself on the top of the hill with the right wing, waited only to
see his left and centre actually in march on the road to Eion, and
then directed his right also to wheel to the left and follow them.</p>

<p>The whole Athenian army were thus in full retreat, marching in
a direction nearly parallel to the Long Wall of Amphipolis, with
their right or unshielded side exposed to the enemy, when Brasidas,
looking over the southernmost gates of the Long Wall with his small
detachment ready marshalled near him, burst out into contemptuous
exclamations on the disorder of their array.<a id="FNanchor_743"
href="#Footnote_743" class="fnanchor">[743]</a> “These men will not
stand us; I see it by the quivering of their spears and of their
heads. Men who reel about in that way, never stand an assailing
enemy. Open the gates for me instantly, and let us sally out with
confidence.”</p>

<p>With that, both the gate of the Long Wall nearest to the palisade,
and the adjoining gate of the palisade itself, were suddenly thrown
open, and Brasidas with his one hundred and fifty chosen<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_472">[p. 472]</span> soldiers issued out
through them to attack the retreating Athenians. Running rapidly
down the straight road which joined laterally the road towards Eion
along which the Athenians were marching, he charged their central
division on the right flank:<a id="FNanchor_744" href="#Footnote_744"
class="fnanchor">[744]</a> their left wing had already got beyond him
on the road towards Eion. Taken completely unprepared, conscious of
their own disorderly array, and astounded at the boldness of their
enemy, the Athenians of the centre were seized with panic, made not
the least resistance, and presently fled. Even the Athenian left,
though not attacked at all, instead of halting to lend assistance,
shared the panic and fled in disorder. Having thus disorganized this
part of the army, Brasidas passed along the line to press his attack
on the Athenian right: but in this movement he was mortally wounded
and carried off the field, unobserved by his enemies. Meanwhile
Klearidas, sallying forth from the Thracian gate, had attacked the
Athenian right on the ridge opposite to him, immediately after it
began its retreat. But the soldiers on the Athe<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_473">[p. 473]</span>nian right had probably seen the
previous movement of Brasidas against the other division, and though
astonished at the sudden danger, had thus a moment’s warning, before
they were themselves assailed, to halt and take close rank on the
hill. Klearidas here found a considerable resistance, in spite of the
desertion of Kleon; who, more astonished than any man in his army by
a catastrophe so unlooked for, lost his presence of mind and fled
at once; but was overtaken by a Thracian peltast from Myrkinus and
slain. His soldiers on the right wing, however, repelled two or three
attacks in front from Klearidas, and maintained their ground, until
at length the Chalkidian cavalry and the peltasts from Myrkinus,
having come forth out of the gates, assailed them with missiles in
flank and rear so as to throw them into disorder. The whole Athenian
army was thus put to flight; the left hurrying to Eion, the men of
the right dispersing and seeking safety among the hilly grounds of
Pangæus in their rear. Their sufferings and loss in the flight, from
the hands of the pursuing peltasts and cavalry, were most severe:
and when they at last again mustered at Eion, not only the commander
Kleon, but six hundred Athenian hoplites, half of the force sent
out, were found missing.<a id="FNanchor_745" href="#Footnote_745"
class="fnanchor">[745]</a></p>

<p>So admirably had the attack been concerted, and so entire was its
success, that only seven men perished on the side of the victors.
But of those seven, one was the gallant Brasidas himself, who being
carried into Amphipolis, lived just long enough to learn the complete
victory of his troops and then expired. Great and bitter was the
sorrow which his death occasioned throughout Thrace, especially among
the Amphipolitans. He received, by special decree, the distinguished
honor of interment within their city, the universal habit being to
inter even the most eminent deceased persons in a suburb without
the walls. All the allies attended his funeral in arms and with
military honors: his tomb was encircled by a railing, and the space
immediately fronting it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_474">[p.
474]</span> was consecrated as the great agora of the city, which was
remodelled accordingly. He was also proclaimed œkist, or founder, of
Amphipolis, and as such, received heroic worship with annual games
and sacrifices to his honor.<a id="FNanchor_746" href="#Footnote_746"
class="fnanchor">[746]</a> The Athenian Agnon, the real founder and
originally recognized œkist of the city, was stripped of all his
commemorative honors and expunged from the remembrance of the people:
his tomb and the buildings connected with it, together with every
visible memento of his name, being destroyed. Full of hatred as the
Amphipolitans now were towards Athens,—and not merely of hatred,
but of fear, since the loss which they had just sustained of their
saviour and protector,—they felt repugnance to the idea of rendering
farther worship to an Athenian œkist. Nor was it convenient to keep
up such a religious link with Athens, now that they were forced to
look anxiously to Lacedæmon for assistance. Klearidas, as governor
of Amphipolis, superintended those numerous alterations in the city
which this important change required, together with the erection of
the trophy, just at the spot where Brasidas had first charged the
Athenians; while the remaining armament of Athens, having obtained
the usual truce and buried their dead, returned home without farther
operations.</p>

<p>There are few battles recorded in history wherein the
disparity and contrast of the two generals opposed has been so
manifest,—consummate skill and courage on the one side against
ignorance and panic on the other. On the singular ability and
courage of Brasidas there can be but one verdict of unqualified
admiration: but the criticism passed by Thucydidês on Kleon, here
as elsewhere, cannot be adopted without reserves. He tells us that
Kleon undertook his march, from Eion up to the hill in front of
Amphipolis, in the same rash and confident spirit with which he
had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_475">[p. 475]</span> embarked
on the enterprise against Pylus, in the blind confidence that no
one would resist him.<a id="FNanchor_747" href="#Footnote_747"
class="fnanchor">[747]</a> Now I have already, in a former chapter,
shown grounds for concluding that the anticipations of Kleon
respecting the capture of Sphakteria, far from being marked by any
spirit of unmeasured presumption, were sober and judicious, realized
to the letter without any unlooked-for aid from fortune. Nor are the
remarks, here made by Thucydidês on that affair, more reasonable
than the judgment on it in his former chapter; for it is not true,
as he here implies, that Kleon expected no resistance in Sphakteria:
he calculated on resistance, but knew that he had force sufficient
to overcome it. His fault even at Amphipolis, great as that fault
was, did not consist in rashness and presumption. This charge at
least is rebutted by the circumstance, that he himself wished to
make no aggressive movement until his reinforcements should arrive,
and that he was only constrained, against his own will, to abandon
his intended temporary inactivity during that interval, by the angry
murmurs of his soldiers, who reproached him with ignorance and
backwardness, the latter quality being the reverse of that with which
he is branded by Thucydidês.</p>

<p>When Kleon was thus driven to do something, his march up to the
top of the hill, for the purpose of reconnoitring the ground, was
not in itself unreasonable, and might have been accomplished in
perfect safety, if he had kept his army in orderly array, prepared
for contingencies. But he suffered himself to be completely
out-generalled and overreached by that simulated consciousness of
impotence and unwillingness to fight, which Brasidas took care to
present to him. Among all military stratagems, this has perhaps been
the most frequently practised with success against inexperienced
generals, who are thrown off their guard and induced to neglect
precaution, not because they are naturally more rash or presumptuous
than ordinary men, but because nothing except either a high order
of intellect, or special practice and training, will enable a
man to keep steadily present to his mind<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_476">[p. 476]</span> liabilities even real and serious, when
there is no discernible evidence to suggest their approach; much more
when there <i>is</i> positive evidence, artfully laid out by a superior
enemy, to create belief in their absence. A fault substantially the
same had been committed by Thucydidês himself and his colleague
Euklês a year and a half before, when they suffered Brasidas to
surprise the Strymonian bridge and Amphipolis: not even taking common
precautions, nor thinking it necessary to keep the fleet at Eion.
They were not men peculiarly rash and presumptuous, but ignorant and
unpractised, in a military sense; incapable of keeping before them
dangerous contingencies which they perfectly knew, simply because
there was no present evidence of approaching explosion.</p>

<p>This military incompetence, which made Kleon fall into the trap
laid for him by Brasidas, also made him take wrong measures against
the danger, when he unexpectedly discovered at last that the enemy
within were preparing to attack him. His fatal error consisted in
giving instant order for retreat, under the vain hope that he could
get away before the enemy’s attack could be brought to bear.<a
id="FNanchor_748" href="#Footnote_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a> An
abler officer, before he commenced the retreating march so close to
the hostile walls, would have taken care to marshal his men in proper
array, to warn and address them with the usual harangue, and to wind
up their courage to the fighting-point: for up to that moment they
had no idea of being called upon to fight; and the courage of Grecian
hoplites, taken thus unawares while hurrying to get away in disorder
visible both to themselves and their enemies, without any of the
usual preliminaries of battle, was but too apt to prove deficient.
To turn the right or unshielded flank to the enemy, was unavoidable
from the direction of the retreating movement; nor is it reasonable
to blame Kleon for this, as some historians have done, or for causing
his right wing to move too soon in following the lead of the left, as
Dr. Arnold seems to think. The grand fault seems to have consisted in
not waiting to marshal his men and prepare them for standing fight
during their retreat. Let us add, however, and the remark, if it
serves to explain Kleon’s idea of being able to get away before he
was actually assailed, counts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_477">[p.
477]</span> as a double compliment to the judgment as well as
boldness of Brasidas, that no other Lacedæmonian general of that
day perhaps, not even Demosthenês, the most enterprising general of
Athens, would have ventured upon an attack with so very small a band,
relying altogether upon the panic produced by his sudden movement.</p>

<p>But the absence of military knowledge and precaution is not the
worst of Kleon’s faults on this occasion. His want of courage at the
moment of conflict is yet more lamentable, and divests his end of
that personal sympathy which would otherwise have accompanied it.
A commander who has been out-generalled is under a double force of
obligation to exert and expose himself, to the uttermost, in order to
retrieve the consequences of his own mistakes. He will thus at least
preserve his own personal honor, whatever censure he may deserve on
the score of deficient knowledge and judgment.<a id="FNanchor_749"
href="#Footnote_749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a></p>

<p>What is said about the disgraceful flight of Kleon himself, must
be applied, with hardly less severity of criticism, to the Athenian
hoplites under him. They behaved in a manner altogether unworthy of
the reputation of their city; especially the left wing, which seems
to have broken and run away without waiting to be attacked. And when
we read in Thucydidês, that the men who thus disgraced themselves
were among the best, and the best-armed hoplites in Athens; that they
came out unwillingly under Kleon; that they began their scornful
murmurs against him before he had committed any fault, despising
him for backwardness when he was yet not strong enough to attempt
anything serious, and was only manifesting a reasonable prudence in
waiting the arrival of expected reinforcements; when we read this,
we shall be led to compare the expedition against Amphipolis with
former manœuvres respecting the attack of Sphakteria, and to discern
other causes for its failure besides the military incompetence of
the commander. These hoplites brought out with them from Athens
the feelings prevalent among the political adversaries of Kleon.
The expedition was proposed and carried by him, contrary to their
wishes: they could not prevent it, but<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_478">[p. 478]</span> their opposition enfeebled it from the
beginning, kept within too narrow limits the force assigned to it,
and was one main reason which frustrated its success.</p>

<p>Had Periklês been alive, Amphipolis might perhaps still have been
lost, since its capture was the fault of the officers employed to
defend it. But if lost, it would probably have been attacked and
recovered with the same energy as the revolted Samos had been, with
the full force and the best generals that Athens could furnish.
With such an armament under good officers, there was nothing at
all impracticable in the reconquest of the place; especially as at
that time it had no defence on three sides except the Strymon, and
might thus be approached by Athenian ships on that navigable river.
The armament of Kleon,<a id="FNanchor_750" href="#Footnote_750"
class="fnanchor">[750]</a> even if his reinforcements had arrived,
was hardly sufficient for the purpose. But Periklês would have been
able to concentrate upon it the whole strength of the city, without
being paralyzed by the contentions of political party: he would have
seen as clearly as Kleon, that the place could only be recovered by
force, and that its recovery was the most important object to which
Athens could devote her energies.</p>

<p>It was thus that the Athenians, partly from political intrigue,
partly from the incompetence of Kleon, underwent a disastrous
defeat instead of carrying Amphipolis. But the death of Brasidas
converted their defeat into a substantial victory. There remained
no Spartan either like or second to that eminent man, either as a
soldier or a conciliating politician; none who could replace him
in the confidence and affection of the allies of Athens in Thrace;
none who could prosecute those enterprising plans against Athens on
her unshielded side, which he had first shown<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_479">[p. 479]</span> to be practicable. The fears of Athens,
and the hopes of Sparta, in respect to the future, disappeared alike
with him. The Athenian generals, Phormio and Demosthenês, had both
of them acquired among the Akarnanians an influence personal to
themselves, apart from their post and from their country: but the
career of Brasidas, exhibited an extent of personal ascendency and
admiration, obtained as well as deserved, such as had never before
been paralleled by any military chieftain in Greece: and Plato
might well select him as the most suitable historical counterpart
to the heroic Achilles.<a id="FNanchor_751" href="#Footnote_751"
class="fnanchor">[751]</a> All the achievements of Brasidas were
his own individually, with nothing more than bare encouragement,
sometimes even without encouragement, from his country. And when we
recollect the strict and narrow routine in which as a Spartan he
had been educated, so fatal to the development of everything like
original thought or impulse, and so completely estranged from all
experience of party or political discussion, we are amazed at his
resource and flexibility of character, his power of adapting himself
to new circumstances and new persons, and his felicitous dexterity
in making himself the rallying-point of opposite political parties
in each of the various cities which he acquired. The combination “of
every sort of practical excellence,” valor, intelligence, probity,
and gentleness of dealing, which his character presented, was never
forgotten among the subject-allies of Athens, and procured for other
Spartan officers in subsequent years favorable presumptions, which
their conduct was seldom found to realize.<a id="FNanchor_752"
href="#Footnote_752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a> At the time when
Brasidas perished, in the flower of his age, he was unquestionably
the first man in Greece; and though it is not given to us to predict
what he would have become had he lived, we may be sure that the
future course of the war would have been sensibly modified; perhaps
even to the advantage of Athens, since she might have had sufficient
occupation at home to keep her from the disastrous enterprise in
Sicily.</p>

<p>Thucydidês seems to take pleasure in setting forth the gallant
exploits of Brasidas, from the first at Methônê to the last at
Amphipolis, not less than the dark side of Kleon; both, though in
different senses, the causes of his banishment. He never<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_480">[p. 480]</span> mentions the latter
except in connection with some proceeding represented as unwise
or discreditable. The barbarities which the offended majesty of
empire thought itself entitled to practise in ancient times against
dependencies revolted and reconquered, reach their maximum in the
propositions against Mitylênê and Skiônê: both of them are ascribed
to Kleon by name as their author. But when we come to the slaughter
of the Melians, equally barbarous, and worse in respect to grounds of
excuse, inasmuch as the Melians had never been subjects of Athens, we
find Thucydidês mentioning the deed without naming the proposer.<a
id="FNanchor_753" href="#Footnote_753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a></p>

<p>Respecting the foreign policy of Kleon, the facts already narrated
will enable the reader to form an idea of it as compared with that
of his opponents. I have shown grounds for believing that Thucydidês
has forgotten his usual impartiality in criticizing this personal
enemy; that in regard to Sphakteria, Kleon was really one main
and indispensable cause of procuring for his country the greatest
advantage which she obtained throughout the whole war; and that in
regard to his judgment as advocating the prosecution of war, three
different times must be distinguished: 1. After the first blockade
of the hoplites in Sphakteria; 2. After the capture of the island;
3. After the expiration of the one year truce. On the earliest of
those three occasions he was wrong, for he seems to have shut the
door on all possibilities of negotiation, by his manner of dealing
with the Lacedæmonian envoys. On the second occasion, he had fair and
plausible grounds to offer on behalf of his opinion, though it turned
out unfortunate: moreover, at that time, all Athens was warlike, and
Kleon is not to be treated as the peculiar adviser of that policy.
On the third and last occasion, after the expiration of the truce,
the political counsel of Kleon was right, judicious, and truly
Periklêan, much surpassing in wisdom that of his opponents. We shall
see in the coming chapters how those opponents managed the affairs
of the state after his death; how Nikias threw away the interests
of Athens in the enforcement of the conditions of peace; how Nikias
and Alkibiadês together shipwrecked the power of their country on
the shores of Syracuse. And when we judge the demagogue Kleon in
this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_481">[p. 481]</span> comparison,
we shall find ground for remarking that Thucydidês is reserved and
even indulgent towards the errors and vices of other statesmen, harsh
only towards those of his accuser.</p>

<p>As to the internal policy of Kleon, and his conduct as a
politician in Athenian constitutional life, we have but little
trustworthy evidence. There exists, indeed, a portrait of him, drawn
in colors broad and glaring, most impressive to the imagination, and
hardly effaceable from the memory; the portrait in the “Knights”
of Aristophanês. It is through this representation that Kleon has
been transmitted to posterity, crucified by a poet who admits
himself to have had a personal grudge against him, just as he has
been commemorated in the prose of an historian whose banishment he
had proposed. Of all the productions of Aristophanês, so replete
with comic genius throughout, the “Knights” is the most consummate
and irresistible; the most distinct in its character, symmetry,
and purpose. Looked at with a view to the object of its author,
both in reference to the audience and to Kleon, it deserves the
greatest possible admiration, and we are not surprised to learn
that it obtained the first prize. It displays the maximum of that
which wit combined with malice can achieve, in covering an enemy
with ridicule, contempt, and odium. Dean Swift would have desired
nothing worse, even for Ditton and Winston. The old man, Demos
of Pnyx, introduced on the stage as personifying the Athenian
people,—Kleon, brought on as his newly-bought Paphlagonian slave,
who by coaxing, lying, impudent and false denunciation of others,
has gained his master’s ear, and heaps ill-usage upon every one
else, while he enriches himself,—the Knights, or chief members
of what we may call the Athenian aristocracy, forming the Chorus
of the piece as Kleon’s pronounced enemies,—the sausage-seller
from the market-place, who, instigated by Nikias find Demosthenês
along with these Knights, overdoes Kleon in all his own low arts,
and supplants him in the favor of Demos; all this, exhibited with
inimitable vivacity of expression, forms the masterpiece and glory
of libellous comedy. The effect produced upon the Athenian audience
when this piece was represented at the Lenæan festival, January
<small>B.C.</small> 424, about six months after the
capture of Sphakteria, with Kleon himself and most of the real<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_482">[p. 482]</span> Knights present, must
have been intense beyond what we can now easily imagine. That Kleon
could maintain himself after this humiliating exposure, is no small
proof of his mental vigor and ability. It does not seem to have
impaired his influence, at least not permanently; for not only do
we see him the most effective opponent of peace during the next two
years, but there is ground for believing that the poet himself found
it convenient to soften his tone towards this powerful enemy.</p>

<p>So ready are most writers to find Kleon guilty, that they are
satisfied with Aristophanês as a witness against him: though no other
public man, of any age or nation, has ever been condemned upon such
evidence. No man thinks of judging Sir Robert Walpole, or Mr. Fox, or
Mirabeau, from the numerous lampoons put in circulation against them:
no man will take measure of a political Englishman from Punch, or of
a Frenchman from the Charivari. The unrivalled comic merit of the
“Knights” of Aristophanês is only one reason the more for distrusting
the resemblance of its picture to the real Kleon. We have means too
of testing the candor and accuracy of Aristophanês by his delineation
of Sokratês, whom he introduced in the comedy of “Clouds” in the year
after that of the “Knights.” As a comedy, the “Clouds” stands second
only to the “Knights”: as a picture of Sokratês, it is little better
than pure fancy: it is not even a caricature, but a totally different
person. We may indeed perceive single features of resemblance; the
bare feet, and the argumentative subtlety, belong to both; but the
entire portrait is such, that if it bore a different name, no one
would think of comparing it with Sokratês, whom we know well from
other sources. With such an analogy before us, not to mention what we
know generally of the portraits of Periklês by these authors, we are
not warranted in treating the portrait of Kleon as a likeness, except
on points where there is corroborative evidence. And we may add, that
some of the hits against him, where we can accidentally test their
pertinence, are decidedly not founded in fact; as, for example, where
the poet accuses Kleon of having deliberately and cunningly robbed
Demosthenês of his laurels in the enterprise against Sphakteria.<a
id="FNanchor_754" href="#Footnote_754" class="fnanchor">[754]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_483">[p. 483]</span></p> <p>In
the prose of Thucydidês, we find Kleon described as a dishonest
politician, a wrongful accuser of others, the most violent of
all the citizens:<a id="FNanchor_755" href="#Footnote_755"
class="fnanchor">[755]</a> throughout the verse of Aristophanês,
these same charges are set forth with his characteristic emphasis,
but others are also superadded; Kleon practises the basest artifices
and deceptions to gain favor with the people, steals the public
money, receives bribes, and extorts compositions from private persons
by wholesale, and thus enriches himself under pretence of zeal for
the public treasury. In the comedy of the Acharnians, represented
one year earlier than the Knights, the poet alludes with great
delight to a sum of five talents, which Kleon had been compelled
“to disgorge”: a present tendered to him by the insular subjects of
Athens, if we may believe Theopompus, for the purpose of procuring
a remission of their tribute, and which the Knights, whose evasions
of military service he had exposed, compelled him to relinquish.<a
id="FNanchor_756" href="#Footnote_756" class="fnanchor">[756]</a></p>

<p>But when we put together the different heads of indictment
accumulated by Aristophanês, it will be found that they are not
easily reconcilable one with the other; for an Athenian, whose temper
led him to violent crimination of others, at the inevitable price
of multiplying and exasperating personal enemies, would find it
peculiarly dangerous, if not impossible, to carry on peculation for
his own account. If, on the other hand, he took the latter turn, he
would be inclined to purchase connivance from others even by winking
at real guilt on their part, far from making himself conspicuous
as a calumniator of innocence. We must therefore discuss the side
of the indictment which is indicated in Thucydidês; not Kleon, as
truckling to the people and cheating for his own pecuniary profit
(which is certainly not the character implied in his speech about
the Mitylenæans, as given<span class="pagenum" id="Page_484">[p.
484]</span> to us by the historian),<a id="FNanchor_757"
href="#Footnote_757" class="fnanchor">[757]</a> but Kleon as a man of
violent temper and fierce political antipathies, a bitter speaker,
and sometimes dishonest in his calumnies against adversaries. These
are the qualities which, in all countries of free debate, go to
form what is called a great opposition speaker. It was thus that
the elder Cato, “the universal biter, whom Persephonê was afraid
even to admit into Hades after his death,” was characterized at
Rome, even by the admission of his admirers to some extent, and in
a still stronger manner by those who were unfriendly to him, as
Thucydidês was to Kleon.<a id="FNanchor_758" href="#Footnote_758"
class="fnanchor">[758]</a> In Cato, such a temper was not<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_485">[p. 485]</span> inconsistent with
a high sense of public duty. And Plutarch recounts an anecdote
respecting Kleon, that, on first beginning his political career,
he called his friends together, and dissolved his intimacy with
them, conceiving that private friendships would distract him
from his paramount duty to the commonwealth.<a id="FNanchor_759"
href="#Footnote_759" class="fnanchor">[759]</a></p>

<p>Moreover, the reputation of Kleon as a frequent and unmeasured
accuser of others, may be explained partly by a passage of his enemy
Aristophanês: a passage the more deserving of confidence as a just
representation of fact, since it appears in a comedy (the “Frogs”)
represented (405 <small>B.C.</small>) fifteen years after
the death of Kleon, and five years after that of Hyperbolus, when
the poet had less motive for misrepresentations against either. In
the “Frogs,” the scene is laid in Hades, whither the god Dionysus
goes, in the attire of Hêraklês and along with his slave Xanthias,
for the purpose of bringing up again to earth the deceased poet
Euripidês. Among the incidents, Xanthias, in the attire which his
master had worn, is represented as acting with violence and insult
towards two hostesses of eating-houses; consuming their substance,
robbing them, refusing to pay when called upon, and even threatening
their lives with a drawn sword. Upon which the women, having no other
redress left, announce their resolution of calling, the one upon her
protector Kleon, the other on Hyperbolus, for the purpose of bringing
the offender to justice before the dikastery.<a id="FNanchor_760"
href="#Footnote_760" class="fnanchor">[760]</a> This passage shows
us, if inferences on comic evidence are to be held as admissible,
that Kleon and Hyperbolus became involved in accusations partly
by helping poor persons who had been wronged to obtain justice
before the dikastery. A rich man who had suffered injury might
apply<span class="pagenum" id="Page_486">[p. 486]</span> to Antipho
or some other rhetor for paid advice and aid as to the conduct
of his complaint; but a poor man or woman would think themselves
happy to obtain the gratuitous suggestion, and sometimes the
auxiliary speech, of Kleon or Hyperbolus; who would thus extend
their own popularity, by means very similar to those practised by
the leading men in Rome.<a id="FNanchor_761" href="#Footnote_761"
class="fnanchor">[761]</a></p>

<p>But besides lending aid to others, doubtless Kleon was often also
a prosecutor, in his own name, of official delinquents, real or
alleged. That some one should undertake this duty was indispensable
for the protection of the city; otherwise, the responsibility to
which official persons were subjected after their term of office
would have been merely nominal: and we have proof enough that
the general public morality of these official persons, acting
individually, was by no means high. But the duty was at the same
time one which most persons would and did shun. The prosecutor,
while obnoxious to general dislike, gained nothing even by the
most complete success; and if he failed so much as not to procure
a minority of votes among the dikasts, equal to one-fifth of the
numbers present, he was condemned to pay a fine of one thousand
drachms. What was still more serious, he drew upon himself a
formidable mass of private hatred, from the friends, partisans, and
the political club, of the accused party, extremely menacing to his
own future security and comfort, in a community like Athens. There
was therefore little motive to accept, and great motive to decline,
the task of prosecuting on public grounds. A prudent politician at
Athens would undertake it occasionally, and against special rivals,
but he would carefully guard himself against the reputation of doing
it frequently or by inclination, and the orators constantly do so
guard themselves in those speeches which yet remain.</p>

<p>It is this reputation which Thucydidês fastens upon Kleon, and
which, like Cato the censor at Rome, he probably merited; from native
acrimony of temper, from a powerful talent for invective<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_487">[p. 487]</span> and from his position,
both inferior and hostile to the Athenian knights, or aristocracy,
who overshadowed him by their family importance. But in what
proportion of cases his accusations were just or calumnious, the
real question upon which a candid judgment turns, we have no
means of deciding, either in his case or that of Cato. “To lash
the wicked (observes Aristophanês himself<a id="FNanchor_762"
href="#Footnote_762" class="fnanchor">[762]</a>) is not only no
blame, but is even a matter of honor to the good.” It has not been
common to allow to Kleon the benefit of this observation, though he
is much more entitled to it than Aristophanês. For the attacks of a
poetical libeller admit neither of defence nor retaliation; whereas a
prosecutor before the dikastery found his opponent prepared to reply
or even to retort, and was obliged to specify his charge, as well
as to furnish proof of it; so that there was a fair chance for the
innocent man not to be confounded with the guilty.</p>

<p>The quarrel of Kleon with Aristophanês is said to have arisen
out of an accusation which he brought against that poet<a
id="FNanchor_763" href="#Footnote_763" class="fnanchor">[763]</a>
in the Senate of Five Hundred, on the subject of his second comedy,
the “Babylonians,” exhibited <small>B.C.</small> 426, at
the festival of the urban Dionysia in the month of March. At that
season many strangers were present at Athens, and especially many
visitors and deputies from the subject-allies, who were bringing
their annual tribute: and as the “Babylonians,” (now lost), like
so many other productions of Aristophanês, was full of slashing
ridicule, not only against individual citizens but against the
functionaries and institutions of the city,<a id="FNanchor_764"
href="#Footnote_764" class="fnanchor">[764]</a> Kleon instituted a
complaint against it in the senate, as an exposure dangerous to the
public<span class="pagenum" id="Page_488">[p. 488]</span> security
before strangers and allies. We have to recollect that Athens was
then in the midst of an embarrassing war; that the fidelity of her
subject-allies was much doubted; that Lesbos, the greatest of her
allies, had been reconquered only in the preceding year, after a
revolt both troublesome and perilous to the Athenians. Under such
circumstances, Kleon had good reason for thinking that a political
comedy of the Aristophanic vein and talent tended to degrade the
city in the eyes of strangers, even granting that it was innocuous
when confined to the citizens themselves. The poet complains<a
id="FNanchor_765" href="#Footnote_765" class="fnanchor">[765]</a>
that Kleon summoned him before the senate, with terrible threats
and calumny: but it does not appear that any penalty was inflicted.
Nor, indeed, had the senate competence to find him guilty or punish
him except to the extent of a small fine: they could only bring him
to trial before the dikastery, which in this case plainly was not
done. He himself, however, seems to have felt the justice of the
warning: for we find that three out of his four next following plays,
before the Peace of Nikias,—the Acharnians, the Knights, and the
Wasps,—were represented at the Lenæan festival,<a id="FNanchor_766"
href="#Footnote_766" class="fnanchor">[766]</a> in the month of
January, a season when no strangers nor allies were present. Kleon
was doubtless much incensed with the play of the Knights, and seems
to have annoyed the poet either by bringing an indictment against him
for exercising freemen’s rights without being duly qualified, since
none but citizens were allowed to appear and<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_489">[p. 489]</span> act in the dramatic exhibitions, or by
some other means which are not clearly explained. Nor can we make
out in what way the poet met him, though it appears that finding
less public sympathy than he thought himself entitled to, he made
an apology without intending to be bound by it.<a id="FNanchor_767"
href="#Footnote_767" class="fnanchor">[767]</a> Certain it is, that
his remaining plays subsequent to the Knights, though containing some
few bitter jests against Kleon, manifest no second deliberate set
against him.</p>

<p>The battle of Amphipolis removed at once the two most pronounced
individual opponents of peace, Kleon and Brasidas. Athens too was
more than ever discouraged and averse to prolonged fighting; for the
number of hoplites slain at Amphipolis doubtless filled the city
with mourning, besides the unparalleled disgrace now tarnishing
Athenian soldiership. The peace-party under the auspices of Nikias
and Lachês, relieved at once from the internal opposition of Kleon,
as well as from the foreign enterprise of Brasidas, were enabled
to resume their negotiations with Sparta in a spirit promising
success. King Pleistoanax, and the Spartan ephors of the year, were
on their side equally bent on terminating the war, and the deputies
of all the allies were convoked at Sparta for discussion with the
envoys of Athens. Such discussion was continued during the whole
autumn and winter after the battle of Amphipolis, without any actual
hostilities on either side. At first, the pretensions advanced were
found very conflicting; but at length, after several debates, it was
agreed to treat upon the basis of each party surrendering what had
been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_490">[p. 490]</span> acquired by
war. The Athenians insisted at first on the restoration of Platæa;
but the Thebans replied that Platæa was theirs neither by force
nor by treason, but by voluntary capitulation and surrender of the
inhabitants. This distinction seems to our ideas somewhat remarkable,
since the capitulation of a besieged town is not less the result
of force than capture by storm. But it was adopted in the present
treaty; and under it the Athenians, while foregoing their demand
of Platæa, were enabled to retain Nisæa, which they had acquired
from the Megarians, and Anaktorium and Sollium,<a id="FNanchor_768"
href="#Footnote_768" class="fnanchor">[768]</a> which they had taken
from Corinth. To insure accommodating temper on the part of Athens,
the Spartans held out the threat of invading Attica in the spring,
and of establishing a permanent fortification in the territory: and
they even sent round proclamation to their allies, enjoining all the
details requisite for this step. Since Attica had now been exempt
from invasion for three years, the Athenians were probably not
insensible to this threat of renewal under a permanent form.</p>

<p>At the beginning of spring, about the end of March, 421
<small>B.C.</small>, shortly after the urban Dionysia at Athens,
the important treaty was concluded for the term of fifty years. The
following were its principal conditions:—</p>

<p>1. All shall have full liberty to visit all the public temples of
Greece, for purposes of private sacrifice, consultation of oracle,
or public sacred mission. Every man shall be undisturbed both in
going and coming. [The value of this article will be felt, when we
recollect that the Athenians and their allies had been unable to
visit the Olympic or Pythian festival since the beginning of the
war.]</p>

<p>2. The Delphians shall enjoy full autonomy and mastery of their
temple and their territory. [This article was intended to exclude the
ancient claim of the Phocian confederacy to the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_491">[p. 491]</span> management of the temple; a claim which
the Athenians had once supported, before the thirty years’ truce: but
they had now little interest in the matter, since the Phocians were
in the ranks of their enemies.]</p>

<p>3. There shall be peace for fifty years, between Athens and Sparta
with their respective allies, with abstinence from mischief, either
overt or fraudulent, by land as well as by sea.</p>

<p>4. Neither party shall invade for purposes of mischief the
territory of the other, not by any artifice or under any pretence.</p>

<p>Should any subject of difference arise, it shall be settled by
equitable means, and by oaths tendered and taken, in form to be
hereafter agreed on.</p>

<p>5. The Lacedæmonians and their allies shall restore Amphipolis to
the Athenians.</p>

<p>They shall farther <i>relinquish</i> to the Athenians Argilus,
Stageirus, Akanthus, Skôlus, Olynthus, and Spartôlus. But these
cities shall remain autonomous, on condition of paying tribute to
Athens according to the assessment of Aristeidês. Any of their
citizens who may choose to quit them shall be at liberty to do so,
and to carry away his property. Nor shall the cities be counted
hereafter either as allies of Athens or of Sparta, unless Athens
shall induce them by amicable persuasions to become her allies, which
she is at liberty to do if she can.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Mekyberna, Sanê, and Singê, shall dwell
independently in their respective cities, just as much as the
Olynthians and Akanthians. [These were towns which adhered to Athens,
and were still numbered as her allies; though they were near enough
to be molested by Olynthus<a id="FNanchor_769" href="#Footnote_769"
class="fnanchor">[769]</a> and Akanthus, against which this clause
was intended to insure them.]</p> <p><span class="pagenum"
id="Page_492">[p. 492]</span></p> <p>The Lacedæmonians and their
allies shall also restore Panaktum to the Athenians.</p>

<p>6. The Athenians shall restore to Sparta Koryphasium, Kythêra,
Methônê, Pteleum, Atalantê, with all the captives in their hands from
Sparta or her allies. They shall farther release all Spartans or
allies of Sparta now blocked up in Skiônê.</p>

<p>7. The Lacedæmonians and their allies shall also restore all the
captives in their hands, from Athens or her allies.</p>

<p>8. Respecting Skiônê, Torônê, Sermylus, or any other town in the
possession of Athens, the Athenians may take their own measures.</p>

<p>9. Oaths shall be exchanged between the contracting parties,
according to the solemnities held most binding in each city
respectively, and in the following words: “I will adhere to this
convention and truce sincerely and without fraud.” The oaths shall
be annually renewed, and the terms of peace shall be inscribed on
columns at Olympia, Delphi, and the Isthmus, as well as at Sparta and
Athens.</p>

<p>10. Should any matter have been forgotten in the present
convention, the Athenians and Lacedæmonians may alter it by mutual
understanding and consent, without being held to violate their
oaths.</p>

<p>These oaths were accordingly exchanged: they were taken by
seventeen principal Athenians, and as many Spartans, on behalf of
their respective countries, on the 26th day of the month Artemisius
at Sparta, and on the 24th day of Elaphebolion at Athens, immediately
after the urban Dionysia; Pleistolas being ephor eponymus at
Sparta, and Alkæus archon eponymus at Athens.<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_493">[p. 493]</span> Among the Lacedæmonians swearing, are
included the two kings Agis and Pleistoanax, the ephor Pleistolas,
and perhaps other ephors, but this we do not know, and Tellis, the
father of Brasidas. Among the Athenians sworn, are comprised Nikias,
Lachês, Agnon, Lamachus, and Demosthenês.<a id="FNanchor_770"
href="#Footnote_770" class="fnanchor">[770]</a></p>

<p>Such was the peace—commonly known by the name of the Peace of
Nikias—concluded in the beginning of the eleventh spring of the
war, which had just lasted ten full years. Its conditions were
put to the vote at Sparta, in the assembly of deputies from the
Lacedæmonian allies, the majority of whom accepted them: which,
according to the condition adopted and sworn to by every member
of the confederacy,<a id="FNanchor_771" href="#Footnote_771"
class="fnanchor">[771]</a> made it binding upon all. There was,
indeed, a special reserve allowed to any particular state in case
of religious scruple, arising out of the fear of offending some of
their gods or heroes, but, saving this reserve, the peace had been
formally acceded to by the decision of the confederates. But it soon
appeared how little the vote of the majority was worth, even when
enforced by the strong pressure of Lacedæmon herself, when the more
powerful members were among the dissentient minority. The Bœotians,
Megarians, and Corinthians, all refused to accept it; nor does it
seem that any deputies from the allies took the oath along with the
Lacedæmonian envoys; though the truce for a year, two years before,<a
id="FNanchor_772" href="#Footnote_772" class="fnanchor">[772]</a> had
been sworn to by Lacedæmonian, Corinthian, Megarian, Sikyonian, and
Epidaurian envoys.</p>

<p>The Corinthians were displeased because they did not recover
Sollium and Anaktorium; the Megarians, because they did not regain
Nisæa; the Bœotians, because they were required to surrender
Panaktum. In spite of the urgent solicitations of Sparta, the
deputies of all these powerful states not only denounced the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_494">[p. 494]</span> peace as unjust,
and voted against it in the general assembly of allies, but
refused to accept it when the vote was carried, and went home to
their respective cities for instructions.<a id="FNanchor_773"
href="#Footnote_773" class="fnanchor">[773]</a></p>

<p>Such were the conditions, and such the accompanying circumstances,
of the Peace of Nikias, which terminated, or professed to terminate,
the great Peloponnesian war, after a duration of ten years.
Its consequences and fruits, in many respects such as were not
anticipated by either of the concluding parties, will be seen in my
next volume.</p>

by the Athenians from Sparta in 425 <small>B.C.</small>,
and the annual tribute then imposed upon it was four talents (Thucyd.
iv, 57). In the Inscription No. 143, ap. Boeckh, Corp. Inscr., we
find some names enumerated of tributary towns, with the amount of
tribute opposite to each, but the stone is too much damaged to give
us much information. Tyrodiza, in Thrace, paid one thousand drachms:
some other towns, or junctions of towns, not clearly discernible,
are rated at one thousand, two thousand, three thousand drachms, one
talent, and even ten talents. This inscription must be anterior to
415 <small>B.C.</small>, when the tribute was converted
into a five per cent. duty upon imports and exports: see Boeckh,
Public Econ. of Athens, and his Notes upon the above-mentioned
Inscription.</p>

<p>It was the practice of Athens not always to rate each tributary
city separately, but sometimes to join several in one collective
rating; probably each responsible for the rest. This seems to have
provoked occasional remonstrances from the allies, in some of which
the rhetor, Antipho, was employed to furnish the speech which the
complainants pronounced before the dikastery: see Antipho ap.
Harpokration, v. Ἀπόταξις—Συντελεῖς. It is greatly to be lamented
that the orations composed by Antipho, for the Samothrakians and
Lindians,—the latter inhabiting one of the three separate towns in
the island of Rhodes,—have not been preserved.</p>

<p id="Footnote_10"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_10">[10]</a></span> Very excellent writers on
Athenian antiquity (Boeckh, Public Econ. of Athens, c. 15, 19, b.
iii; Schömann, Antiq. J. P. Att. sect. lxxiv; K. F. Hermann, Gr.
Staatsalterthümer, sect. 157: compare, however, a passage in Boeckh,
ch. 17, p. 421, Eng. transl., where he seems to be of an opposite
opinion) accept this statement, that the tribute levied by Athenians
upon her allies was doubled some years after the commencement of the
Peloponnesian war,—at which time it was six hundred talents,—and
that it came to amount to twelve hundred talents. Nevertheless, I
cannot follow them, upon the simple authority of Æschinês, and the
Pseudo-Andokidês (Æschin. De Fals. Legat. c. 54, p. 301; Andokidês,
De Pace, c. 1, and the same orator cont. Alkibiad. c. 4). For we
may state pretty confidently, that neither of the two orations here
ascribed to Andokidês is genuine: the oration against Alkibiadês
most decidedly not genuine. There remains, therefore, as an original
evidence, only the passage of Æschinês, which has, apparently, been
copied by the author of the Oration De Pace, ascribed to Andokidês.
Now the chapter of Æschinês, which professes to furnish a general
but brief sketch of Athenian history for the century succeeding
the Persian invasion, is so full of historical and chronological
inaccuracies, that we can hardly accept it, when standing alone,
as authority for any matter of fact. In a note on the chapter
immediately preceding, I have already touched upon its extraordinary
looseness of statement,—pointed out by various commentators, among
them particularly by Mr. Fynes Clinton: see above, chap. xlv, note
<sup>2</sup>, pp. 409-411, in the preceding volume.</p>

<p>The assertion, therefore, that the tribute from the Athenian
allies was raised to the sum of twelve hundred talents annually,
comes to us only from the orator Æschinês as an original witness: and
in him it forms part of a tissue of statements alike confused and
incorrect. But against it we have a powerful negative argument,—the
perfect silence of Thucydidês. Is it possible that that historian
would have omitted all notice of a step so very important in
its effects, if Athens had really adopted it? He mentions to us
the commutation by Athens of the tribute from her allies into
a duty of five per cent. payable by them on their exports and
imports (vii, 28)—this was in the nineteenth year of the war, 413
<small>B.C.</small> But anything like the duplication of the tribute
all at once, would have altered much more materially the relations
between Athens and her allies and would have constituted in the
minds of the latter a substantive grievance, such as to aggravate
the motive for revolt in a manner which Thucydidês could hardly
fail to notice. The orator Æschinês refers the augmentation of the
tribute, up to twelve hundred talents, to the time succeeding the
peace of Nikias: M. Boeckh (Public Econ. of Athens, b. iii, ch.
15-19, pp. 400-434) supposes it to have taken place earlier than the
representation of the Vespæ of Aristophanês, that is, about three
years before that peace, or 423 <small>B.C.</small> But this would
have been just before the time of the expedition of Brasidas into
Thrace, and his success in exciting revolt among the dependencies of
Athens: if Athens had doubled her tribute upon all the allies, just
before that expedition, Thucydidês could not have omitted to mention
it, as increasing the chances of success to Brasidas, and helping to
determine the resolutions of the Akanthians and others, which were by
no means adopted unanimously or without hesitation, to revolt.</p>

<p>In reference to the oration called that of Andokidês against
Alkibiadês, I made some remarks in the fourth volume of this History
(vol. iv, ch. xxxi, p. 151), tending to show it to be spurious and of
a time considerably later than that to which it purports to belong. I
will here add one other remark, which appears to me decisive, tending
to the same conclusion.</p>

<p>The oration professes to be delivered in a contest of ostracism
between Nikias, Alkibiadês, and the speaker: one of the three,
he says, must necessarily be ostracized, and the question is, to
determine which of the three: accordingly, the speaker dwells upon
many topics calculated to raise a bad impression of Alkibiadês, and a
favorable impression of himself.</p>

<p>Among the accusations against Alkibiadês, one is, that after
having recommended, in the assembly of the people, that the
inhabitants of Melos should be sold as slaves, he had himself
purchased a Melian woman among the captives, and had had a son by
her: it was criminal, argues the speaker, to beget offspring by a
woman whose relations he had contributed to cause to be put to death,
and whose city he had contributed to ruin (c. 8).</p>

<p>Upon this argument I do not here touch, any farther than to bring
out the point of chronology. The speech, if delivered at all, must
have been delivered, at the earliest, nearly a year after the capture
of Melos by the Athenians: it may be of later date, but it <i>cannot
possibly be earlier</i>.</p>

<p>Now Melos surrendered in the winter immediately preceding
the great expedition of the Athenians to Sicily in 415
<small>B.C.</small>, which expedition sailed about midsummer (Thucyd.
v, 116; vi, 30). Nikias and Alkibiadês both went as commanders of
that expedition: the latter was recalled to Athens for trial on the
charge of impiety about three months afterwards, but escaped in the
way home, was condemned and sentenced to banishment in his absence,
and did not return to Athens until 407 <small>B.C.</small>, long
after the death of Nikias, who continued in command of the Athenian
armament in Sicily, enjoying the full esteem of his countrymen, until
its complete failure and ruin before Syracuse,—and perished himself
afterwards as a Syracusan prisoner.</p>

<p>Taking these circumstances together, it will at once be seen
that there never can have been any time, ten months or more
after the capture of Melos, when Nikias and Alkibiadês <i>could</i>
have been exposed to a vote of ostracism at Athens. The thing is
absolutely impossible: and the oration in which such historical and
chronological incompatibilities are embodied, must be spurious:
furthermore, it must have been composed long after the pretended
time of delivery, when the chronological series of events had been
forgotten.</p>

<p>I may add that the story of this duplication of the tribute by
Alkibiadês is virtually contrary to the statement of Plutarch,
probably borrowed from Æschinês, who states that the demagogues
<i>gradually</i> increased (κατὰ μικρὸν) the tribute to thirteen hundred
talents (Plutarch, Aristeid. c. 24).</p>

<p id="Footnote_12"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_12">[12]</a></span> Thucyd. i, 80. The foresight of
the Athenian people, in abstaining from immediate use of public money
and laying it up for future wants, would be still more conspicuously
demonstrated, if the statement of Æschinês, the orator, were true,
that they got together seven thousand talents between the peace
of Nikias and the Sicilian expedition. M. Boeckh believes this
statement, and says: “It is not impossible that one thousand talents
might have been laid by every year, as the amount of tribute received
was so considerable.” (Public Economy of Athens, ch. xx. p. 446, Eng.
Trans.) I do not believe the statement: but M. Boeckh and others, who
do admit it, ought in fairness to set it against the many remarks
which they pass in condemnation of the democratical prodigality.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_13"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_13">[13]</a></span> Thucyd. i. 122-143; ii, 13. The
πεντηκοστὴ, or duty of two per cent. upon imports and exports at
the Peiræus, produced to the state a revenue of thirty-six talents
in the year in which it was farmed by Andokidês, somewhere about
400 <small>B.C.</small>, after the restoration of the
democracy at Athens from its defeat and subversion at the close of
the Peloponnesian war (Andokidês de Mysteriis, c. 23, p. 65). This
was at a period of depression in Athenian affairs, and when trade was
doubtless not near so good as it had been during the earlier part of
the Peloponnesian war.</p>

<p>It seems probable that this must have been the most considerable
permanent source of Athenian revenue next to the tribute; though we
do not know what rate of customs-duty was imposed at the Peiræus
during the Peloponnesian war. Comparing together the two passages
of Xenophon (Republ. Ath. 1, 17, and Aristophan. Vesp. 657), we may
suppose that the regular and usual rate of duty was one per cent. or
one ἑκατοστὴ,—while in case of need this may have been doubled or
tripled.—τὰς πολλὰς ἑκατοστάς, (see Boeckh, b. iii, chs. 1-4, pp.
298-318, Eng. Trans.) The amount of revenue derived even from this
source, however, can have borne no comparison to the tribute.</p>

Miltiadês and Kimon, as well as with Olorus, king of one of the
Thracian tribes, whose daughter Hegesipylê was wife of Miltiadês, the
conqueror of Marathon. In this manner, therefore, he belonged to one

Plutarch gives no precise date, and O. Müller (De Phidiæ Vitâ, p. 9)
places these steps for convocation of a congress before the first
war between Sparta and Athens and the battle of Tanagra,—<i>i. e.</i>,
before 460 <small>B.C.</small> But this date seems to me
improbable: Thebes was not yet renovated in power, nor had Bœotia
as yet recovered from the fruits of her alliance with the Persians;
moreover, neither Athens nor Periklês himself seem to have been at
that time in a situation to conceive so large a project; which suits
in every respect much better for the later period, after the thirty
years’ truce, but before the Peloponnesian war.</p>

of Plutarch—over and above the concise narrative of Thucydidês—appear
to be borrowed from exaggerated party stories of the day. We need
make no remark upon the story, that Periklês was induced to take
the side of Milêtus against Samos, by the fact that Aspasia was a
native of Milêtus. Nor is it at all more credible that the satrap
Pissuthnês, from good-will towards Samos, offered Periklês ten
thousand golden staters as an inducement to spare Samos. It may
perhaps be true however, that the Samian oligarchy, and those wealthy
men whose children were likely to be taken as hostages, tried the
effect of large bribes upon the mind of Periklês, to prevail upon him
not to alter the government.</p>

Sophoklês was at this time in peculiar favor, from the success of
his tragedy, Antigonê, the year before. See the chronology of these

<p id="Footnote_56"><span class="label"><a

Plutarch seems to have had before him accounts respecting this
Samian campaign, not only from Ephorus, Stesimbrotus, and Duris,
but also from Aristotle: and the statements of the latter must have
differed thus far from Thucydidês, that he affirmed Melissus the
Samian general to have been victorious over Periklês himself, which
is not to be reconciled with the narrative of Thucydidês. </p> <p>
The Samian historian, Duris, living about a century after this siege,
seems to have introduced many falsehoods respecting the cruelties of
Athens: see Plutarch, <i>l. c.</i></p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_57"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_57">[57]</a></span> It appears very improbable that
this Thucydidês can be the historian himself. If it be Thucydidês son
of Melêsias, we must suppose him to have been restored from ostracism
before the regular time,—a supposition indeed noway inadmissible in
itself, but which there is nothing else to countenance. The author of
the Life of Sophoklês, as well as most of the recent critics, adopt
this opinion. </p> <p> On the other hand, it may have been a third
person named Thucydidês; for the name seems to have been common, as
we might guess from the two words of which it is compounded. We find
a third Thucydidês mentioned viii, 92—a native of Pharsalus: and the
biographer, Marcellinus seems to have read of many persons so called
(Θουκύδιδαι πολλοὶ, p. xvi, ed. Arnold). The subsequent history of
Thucydidês son of Melêsias, is involved in complete obscurity. We do
not know the incident to which the remarkable passage in Aristophanês
(Acharn. 703) alludes,—compare Vespæ, 946: nor can we confirm the
statement which the Scholiast cites from Idomeneus, to the effect
that Thucydidês was banished and fled to Artaxerxes: see Bergk.

<p>In the oration against the Athenians, delivered by the Syracusan

allies partly on the ground that they neglected to perform their
military obligations, partly because they made war upon each other
(Thucyd. vi, 76), partly also on other specious pretences. How far
this charge against Athens is borne out by the fact, we can hardly
say; in all those particular examples which Thucydidês mentions of

καλοὺς κἀγαθοὺς ὀνομαζομένους οὐκ ἐλάσσω αὐτοὺς (that is, the
subject-allies) νομίζειν σφίσι πράγματα παρέξειν τοῦ δήμου,
ποριστὰς ὄντας καὶ ἐσηγητὰς τῶν κακῶν τῷ δήμῳ, ἐξ ὧν τὰ πλείω
αὐτοὺς ὠφελεῖσθαι· καὶ τὸ μὲν ἐπ᾽ ἐκείνοις εἶναι καὶ ἄκριτοι ἂν καὶ
βιαιότερον ἀποθνήσκειν, τὸν δὲ δῆμον σφῶν τε καταφυγὴν εἶναι καὶ
ἐκείνων σωφρονιστήν. Καὶ ταῦτα παρ᾽ αὐτῶν τῶν ἔργων ἐπισταμένας τὰς
πόλεις σαφῶς αὐτὸς εἰδέναι, ὅτι οὕτω νομίζουσιν. This is introduced
as the deliberate judgment of the Athenian commander Phrynichus, whom
Thucydidês greatly commends for his sagacity, and with whom he seems
in this case to have concurred.</p>

<p>Xenophon (Rep. Ath. i. 14, 15) affirms that the Athenian officers
on service passed many unjust sentences upon the oligarchical party
in the allied cities,—fines, sentences of banishment, capital
punishments; and that the Athenian people, though they had a strong
public interest in the prosperity of the allies, in order that their
tribute might be larger, nevertheless thought it better that any
individual citizen of Athens should pocket what he could out of the
plunder of the allies, and leave to the latter nothing more than
was absolutely necessary for them to live and work, without any
superfluity, such as might tempt them to revolt.</p>

<p>That the Athenian officers on service may have succeeded too often
in unjust peculation at the cost of the allies, is probable enough:
but that the Athenian people were pleased to see their own individual
citizens so enriching themselves is certainly not true. The large
jurisdiction of the dikasteries was intended, among other effects,
to open to the allies a legal redress against such misconduct on
the part of the Athenian officers: and the passage above cited from
Thucydidês proves that it really produced such an effect.</p>

γ᾽ ἂν οὖν οἰόμεθα τὰ ἡμέτερα λαβόντας δεῖξαι ἂν μάλιστα εἴ τι
μετριάζομεν· ἡμῖν δὲ καὶ ἐκ τοῦ ἐπιεικοῦς ἀδοξία τὸ πλέον ἢ ἔπαινος
οὐκ εἰκότως περιέστη. Καὶ ἐλασσούμενοι γὰρ ἐν ταῖς ξυμβολαίαις πρὸς
τοὺς ξυμμάχους δίκαις, καὶ παρ᾽ ἡμῖν αὐτοῖς ἐν τοῖς ὁμοίοις νόμοις
ποιήσαντες τὰς κρίσεις, φιλοδικεῖν δοκοῦμεν, etc.</p>

<p>I construe ξυμβολαίαις δίκαις as connected in meaning with
ξυμβόλαια and not with ξύμβολα—following Duker and Bloomfield in
preference to Poppo and Göller: see the elaborate notes of the
two latter editors. Δίκαι ἀπὸ ξυμβόλων indicated the arrangements
concluded by special convention between two different cities, by
consent of both, for the purpose of determining controversies between
their respective citizens: they were something essentially apart
from the ordinary judicial arrangements of either state. Now what
the Athenian orator here insists upon is exactly the contrary of
this idea: he says, that the allies were admitted to the benefit of
Athenian trial and Athenian laws, in like manner with the citizens
themselves. The judicial arrangements by which the Athenian allies
were brought before the Athenian dikasteries cannot, with propriety,
be said to be δίκαι ἀπὸ ξυμβόλων; unless the act of original
incorporation into the confederacy of Delos is to be regarded as a
ξύμβολον, or agreement,—which in a large sense it might be, though
not in the proper sense in which δίκαι ἀπὸ ξυμβόλων are commonly
mentioned. Moreover. I think that the passage of Antipho (De Cæde
Herôdis, p. 745) proves that it was the citizens of places <i>not in
alliance with Athens</i>, who litigated with Athenians according to
δίκαι ἀπὸ ξυμβόλων,—not the allies of Athens while they resided in
their own native cities; for I agree with the interpretation which
Boeckh puts upon this passage, in opposition to Platner and Schömann
(Boeckh, Public Econ. of Athens, book iii, ch. xvi, p. 403, Eng.
transl.; Schömann, Der Attisch. Prozess, p. 778; Platner, Prozess und
Klagen bei den Attikern, ch. iv, 2, pp. 110-112, where the latter
discusses both the passages of Antipho and Thucydidês).</p>

<p>The passages in Demosthenês Orat. de Halones. c. 3, pp. 98, 99;
and Andokidês cont. Alkibiad. c. 7, p. 121 (I quote this latter
oration, though it is undoubtedly spurious, because we may well
suppose the author of it to be conversant with the nature and
contents of ξύμβολα), give us a sufficient idea of these judicial
conventions, or ξύμβολα,—special and liable to differ in each
particular case. They seem to me essentially distinct from that
systematic scheme of proceeding whereby the dikasteries of Athens
were made cognizant of all, or most, important controversies among or
between the allied cities, as well as of political accusations.</p>

<p>M. Boeckh draws a distinction between the <i>autonomous</i> allies
(Chios and Lesbos, at the time immediately before the Peloponnesian
war) and the <i>subject</i>-allies: “the former class (he says) retained
possession of unlimited jurisdiction, whereas the latter were
compelled to try all their disputes in the courts of Athens.”
Doubtless this distinction would prevail to a certain degree, but
how far it was pushed we can hardly say. Suppose that a dispute
took place between Chios and one of the subject islands, or between
an individual Chian and an individual Thasian; would not the Chian
plaintiff sue, or the Chian defendant be sued, before the Athenian
dikastery? Suppose that an Athenian citizen or officer became
involved in dispute with a Chian, would not the Athenian dikastery
be the competent court, whichever of the two were plaintiff or
defendant? Suppose a Chian citizen or magistrate to be suspected of
fomenting revolt, would it not be competent to any accuser, either
Chian or Athenian, to indict him before the dikastery at Athens?
Abuse of power, or peculation, committed by Athenian officers at
Chios, must of course be brought before the Athenian dikasteries,
just as much as if the crime had been committed at Thasos or Naxos.
We have no evidence to help us in regard to these questions; but
I incline to believe that the difference in respect to judicial
arrangement, between the autonomous and the subject-allies, was
less in degree than M. Boeckh believes. We must recollect that the
arrangement was not all pure hardship to the allies,—the liability to
be prosecuted was accompanied with the privilege of prosecuting for
injuries received.</p>

<p>There is one remark, however, which appears to me of importance
for understanding the testimonies on this subject. The Athenian
empire, properly so called, which began by the confederacy of Delos
after the Persian invasion, was completely destroyed at the close of
the Peloponnesian war, when Athens was conquered and taken. But after
some years had elapsed, towards the year 377 <small>B.C.</small>,
Athens again began to make maritime conquests, to acquire allies,
to receive tribute, to assemble a synod, and to resume her footing
of something like an imperial city. But her power over her allies,
during this second period of empire, was nothing like so great as
it had been during the first, between the Persian and Peloponnesian
wars: nor can we be at all sure that what is true of the second
is also true of the first. Now I think it probable, that those
statements of the grammarians, which represent the allies as carrying
on δίκας ἀπὸ ξυμβόλων in ordinary practice with the Athenians,
may really be true about the second empire or alliance. Bekker
Anecdota, p. 436. Ἀθηναῖοι ἀπὸ ξυμβόλων ἐδίκαζον τοῖς ὑπηκόοις·
οὕτως Ἀριστοτέλης. Pollux, viii. 63. Ἀπὸ συμβόλων δὲ δίκη ἦν, ὅτε
οἱ σύμμαχοι ἐδικάζοντο. Also Hesychius, i, 489. The statement here
ascribed to Aristotle may very probably be true about the second
alliance, though it cannot be held true for the first. In the second,
the Athenians may really have had σύμβολα, or special conventions for
judicial business, with many of their principal allies, instead of
making Athens the authoritative centre, and heir to the Delian synod,
as they did during the first. It is to be remarked, however, that
Harpokration, in the explanation which he gives of σύμβολα treats
them in a perfectly general way, as contentions for settlement of
judicial controversy between city and city, without any particular
allusion to Athens and her allies. Compare Heffter, Athenäische
Gerichtsverfassung, iii, 1, 3, p. 91.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_91"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_91">[91]</a></span> It is to be recollected that
the Athenian empire was essentially <i>a government of dependencies</i>;
Athens, as an imperial state, exercising authority over subordinate
governments. To maintain beneficial relations between two
governments, one supreme, the other subordinate, and to make the
system work to the satisfaction of the people in the one as well
as of the people in the other, has always been found a problem of
great difficulty. Whoever reads the instructive volume of Mr. G.
C. Lewis (Essay on the Government of Dependencies), and the number
of instances of practical misgovernment in this matter which are
set forth therein, will be inclined to think that the empire of
Athens over her allies makes comparatively a creditable figure. It
will, most certainly, stand full comparison with the government of
England, over dependencies, in the last century; as illustrated by
the history of Ireland, with the penal laws against the Catholics; by
the Declaration of Independence, published in 1776, by the American
colonies, setting forth the grounds of their separation; and by the
pleadings of Mr. Burke against Warren Hastings.</p>

<p>A statement and legal trial alluded to by Mr. Lewis (p. 367),
elucidates, farther, two points not unimportant on the present
occasion: 1. The illiberal and humiliating vein of sentiment which
is apt to arise in citizens of the supreme government towards those
of the subordinate. 2. The protection which English jury-trial,
nevertheless, afforded to the citizens of the dependency against
oppression by English officers.</p>

<p>“An action was brought, in the court of Common Pleas, in 1773, by
Mr. Anthony Fabrigas, a native of Minorca, against General Mostyn,
the governor of the island. The facts proved at the trial were, that
Governor Mostyn had arrested the plaintiff, imprisoned him, and
transported him to Spain, without any form of trial, on the ground
that the plaintiff had presented to him a petition for redress of
grievances, in a manner which he deemed improper. Mr. Justice Gould
left it to the jury to say, whether the plaintiff’s behavior was
such as to afford a just conclusion that he was about to stir up
sedition and mutiny in the garrison, or whether he meant no more than
earnestly to press his suit and obtain a redress of grievances. If
they thought the latter, the plaintiff was entitled to recover in
the action. The jury gave a verdict for the plaintiff <i>with</i> £3,000
<i>damages</i>. In the following term, an application was made for a new
trial, which was refused by the whole court.</p>

<p>“The following remarks of the counsel for Governor Mostyn, on
this trial, contain a plain and <i>naïve</i> statement of the doctrine,
<i>that a dependency is to be governed, not for its own interest,
but for that of the dominant state</i>. ‘Gentlemen of the jury,’ said
the counsel, ‘it will be time for me now to take notice of another
circumstance, notorious to all the gentlemen who have been settled in
the island, that the natives of Minorca are but ill-affected to the
English, and to the English government. It is not much to be wondered
at. They are the descendants of Spaniards; and they consider Spain
as the country to which they ought naturally to belong: it is not
at all to be wondered at that they are indisposed to the English,
whom they consider as their conquerors.—Of all the Minorquins in the
island, the plaintiff perhaps stands singularly and eminently the
most seditious, turbulent, and dissatisfied subject to the crown of
Great Britain that is to be found in Minorca. Gentlemen, <i>he is, or
chooses to be called, the patriot of Minorca</i>. Now patriotism is a
very pretty thing among ourselves, and we owe much to it: we owe
our liberties to it; but we should have but little to value, and we
should have but little of what we now enjoy, were it not for our
trade. <i>And for the sake of our trade, it is not fit that we should
encourage patriotism in Minorca</i>; for it is there destructive of
our trade, and there is an end to our trade in the Mediterranean,
if it goes there. But <i>here it is very well</i>; for the body of the
people in this country will have it: they have demanded it,—and in
consequence of their demands, they have enjoyed liberties which they
will transmit to their posterity,—and it is not in the power of
this government to deprive them of it. But they will take care of
all our conquests abroad. If that spirit prevailed in Minorca, the
consequence would be the loss of that country, and of course of our
Mediterranean trade. We should be sorry to set all our slaves free in
our plantations.’”</p>

<p>The prodigious sum of damages awarded by the jury, shows the
strength of their sympathy with this Minorquin plaintiff against
the English officer. I doubt not that the feeling of the dikastery
at Athens was much of the same kind, and often quite as strong;
sincerely disposed to protect the subject-allies against misconduct
of Athenian trierarchs, or inspectors.</p>

<p>The feelings expressed in the speech above cited would also often
find utterance from Athenian orators in the assembly; and it would
not be difficult to produce parallel passages, in which these orators
imply discontent on the part of the allies to be the natural state
of things, such as Athens could not hope to escape. The speech here
given shows that such feelings arise, almost inevitably, out of
the uncomfortable relation of two governments, one supreme and the
other subordinate. They are not the product of peculiar cruelty and
oppression on the part of the Athenian democracy, as Mr. Mitford and
so many others have sought to prove.</p>

that the possession of Amphipolis would be injurious rather than

Philip, from his power of annoying her colonists,—just as she had
been dependent before upon Mêdokus, the Thracian king, in consequence
of her colonists in the Chersonese,—ἀναγκασθησόμεθα τὴν αὐτὴν

Thucydidês presents some geographical difficulties which the critics
have not adequately estimated. Are we to assume as certain, that the
<i>Berœa</i> here mentioned must be the Macedonian town of that name,
afterwards so well known, distant from the sea westward one hundred
and sixty stadia, or nearly twenty English miles (see Tafel, Historia
Thessalonicæ, p. 58), on a river which flows into the Haliakmon, and
upon one of the lower ridges of Mount Bermius?</p>

<p>The words of Thucydidês here are—Ἔπειτα δὲ ξύμβασιν
ποιησάμενοι καὶ ξυμμαχίαν ἀναγκαίαν πρὸς τὸν Περδίκκαν, ὡς
αὐτοὺς κατήπειγεν ἡ Ποτίδαια καὶ ὁ Ἀριστεὺς παρεληλυθὼς, <em
class="gesperrt">ἀπανίστανται ἐκ τῆς Μακεδονίας</em>, καὶ ἀφικόμενοι
ἐς Βέροιαν κἀκεῖθεν ἐπιστρέψαντες, καὶ πειράσαντες πρῶτον τοῦ χωρίου
καὶ οὐχ ἑλόντες, ἐπορεύοντο κατὰ γῆν πρὸς τὴν Ποτίδαιαν—ἅμα δὲ νῆες
παρέπλεον ἑβδομήκοντα.</p>

<p>“The natural route from Pydna to Potidæa (observes Dr. Arnold in
his note) lay along the coast; and Berœa was <i>quite out of the way</i>,
at some <i>distance to the westward</i>, near the fort of the Bermian
mountains. But the hope of surprising Berœa induced the Athenians to
deviate from their direct line of march; then, after the failure of
this treacherous attempt, they returned again to the sea-coast, and
continued to follow it till they arrived at Gigônus.”</p>

<p>I would remark upon this: 1. The words of Thucydidês imply that
Berœa was <i>not in</i> Macedonia, but <i>out</i> of it (see Poppo, Proleg.
ad Thucyd. vol. ii, pp. 408-418). 2. He uses no expression which
in the least implies that the attempt on Berœa on the part of the
Athenians was <i>treacherous</i>, that is, contrary to the convention just
concluded; though, had the fact been so, he would naturally have been
led to notice it, seeing that the deliberate breach of the convention
was the very first step which took place after it was concluded. 3.
What can have induced the Athenians to leave their fleet and march
near twenty miles inland to Mount Bermius and Berœa, to attack a
Macedonian town which they could not possibly hold,—when they cannot
even stay to continue the attack on Pydna, a position maritime,
useful, and tenable,—in consequence of the pressing necessity of
taking immediate measures against Potidæa? 4. If they were compelled
by this latter necessity to patch up a peace on any terms with
Perdikkas, would they immediately endanger this peace by going out of
their way to attack one of his forts? Again, Thucydidês says, “that,
proceeding by slow land-marches, they reached Gigônus, and encamped
<i>on the third day</i>,”—κατ᾽ ὀλίγον δὲ προϊόντες τριταῖοι ἀφίκοντο ἐς
Γίγωνον καὶ ἐστρατοπεδεύσαντο. The computation of time must here be
made either from Pydna or from Berœa; and the reader who examines the
map will see that neither from the one nor the other—assuming the
Berœa on Mount Bermius—would it be possible for an army to arrive
at Gigônus on the third day, marching round the head of the gulf,
with easy days’ marches; the more so, as they would have to cross
the rivers Lydias, Axius. and Echeidôrus, all not far from their
mouths,—or, if these rivers could not be crossed, to get on board the
fleet and reland on the other side.</p>

<p>This clear mark of time laid down by Thucydidês,—even apart
from the objections which I have just urged in reference to Berœa
on Mount Bermius,—made me doubt whether Dr. Arnold and the other
commentators have correctly conceived the operations of the Athenian
troops between Pydna and Gigônus. The <i>Berœa</i> which Thucydidês means
cannot be more distant from Gigônus, at any rate, than a third day’s
easy march, and therefore cannot be the Berœa on Mount Bermius. But
there was another town named Berœa, either in Thrace or in Emathia,
though we do not know its exact site (see Wassi ad Thucyd. i, 61;
Steph. Byz. v, Βέρης; Tafel, Thessalonica, Index). This other Berœa,
situated somewhere between Gigônus and Therma, and out of the limits
of that Macedonia which Perdikkas governed, may probably be the place
which Thucydidês here indicates. The Athenians, raising the siege of
Pydna, crossed the gulf <i>on shipboard</i> to Berœa, and after vainly
trying to surprise that town, marched along <i>by land</i> to Gigônus.
Whoever inspects the map will see that the Athenians would naturally
employ their large fleet to transport the army by the short transit
across the gulf from Pydna (see Livy, xliv, 10), and thus avoid
the fatiguing land-march round the head of the gulf. Moreover, the
language of Thucydidês would seem to make the land-march <i>begin at
Berœa</i> and not at Pydna,—<em class="gesperrt">ἀπανίστανται</em> ἐκ
τῆς Μακεδονίας, καὶ <em class="gesperrt">ἀφικόμενοι ἐς Βέροιαν</em>
κἀκεῖθεν ἐπιστρέψαντες, καὶ πειράσαντες πρῶτον τοῦ χωρίου καὶ
οὐχ ἑλόντες, <em class="gesperrt">ἐπορεύοντο κατὰ γῆν</em> πρὸς
Ποτίδαιαν—ἅμα δὲ νῆες παρέπλεον ἑβδομήκοντα. Κατ᾽ ὀλίγον δὲ προϊόντες
τριταῖοι ἀφίκοντο ἐς Γίγωνον καὶ ἐστρατοπεδεύσαντο. The change of
tense between ἀπανίστανται and ἐπορεύοντο,—and the connection of the
participle ἀφικόμενοι with the latter verb,—seems to divide the whole
proceeding into two distinct parts; first, departure from Macedonia
to Berœa, as it would seem, by sea,—next, a land-march from Berœa to
Gigônus, of three short days.</p>

<p>This is the best account, as it strikes me, of a passage, the real
difficulties of which are imperfectly noticed by the commentators.</p>

<p>The site of Gigônus cannot be exactly determined, since all that
we know of the towns on the coast between Potidæa and Æneia, is
derived from their enumerated names in Herodotus (vii, 123); nor can
we be absolutely certain that he has enumerated them all in the exact
order in which they were placed. But I think that both Col. Leake
and Kiepert’s map place Gigônus too far from Potidæa; for we see,
from this passage of Thucydidês, that it formed the camp from which
the Athenian general went forth immediately to give battle to an
enemy posted between Olynthus and Potidæa; and the Scholiast says of
Gigônus,—οὐ πολὺ ἄπεχον Ποτιδαίας: and Stephan. Byz. Γίγωνος, πόλις
Θρᾴκης <em class="gesperrt">προσεχὴς τῇ Παλλήνῃ</em>.</p>

<p>See Colonel Leake, Travels in Northern Greece, vol. iii, ch.
xxxi, p. 452. That excellent observer calculates the march, from
Berœa on Mount Bermius to Potidæa, as being one of four days, about
twenty miles each day. Judging by the map, this seems lower than
the reality; but admitting it to be correct, Thucydidês would never
describe such a march as <em class="gesperrt">κατ᾽ ὀλίγον</em> δὲ
προϊόντες τριταῖοι ἀφίκοντο ἐς Γίγωνον: it would be a march rather
rapid and fatiguing, especially as it would include the passage of
the rivers. Nor is it likely, from the description of this battle
in Thucydidês (i, 62), that Gigônus could be anything like a full
day’s march from Potidæa. According to his description, the Athenian
army advanced by three very easy marches; then arriving at Gigônus,
they encamp, being now near the enemy, who on their side are
already encamped, expecting them,—προσδεχόμενοι τοὺς Ἀθηναίους <em
class="gesperrt">ἐστρατοπεδεύοντο</em> πρὸς Ὀλύνθου ἐν τῷ ἰσθμῷ: the
imperfect tense indicates that they were already there at the time
when the Athenians took camp at Gigônus; which would hardly be the
case if the Athenians had come by three successive marches from Berœa
on Mount Bermius.</p>

<p>I would add, that it is no more wonderful that there should be one
Berœa in Thrace and another in Macedonia, than that there should be
one Methônê in Thrace and another in Macedonia (Steph. B. Μεθώνη).</p>

<p>I agree with Göller that two distinct violations of right are
here imputed to the Megarians: the one, that they had cultivated
land, the property of the goddesses at Eleusis,—the other, that they
had appropriated and cultivated the unsettled pasture land on the
border. Dr. Arnold’s note takes a different view, less correct, in
my opinion: “The land on the frontier was consecrated to prevent it
from being inclosed: in which case the boundaries might have been a
subject of perpetual dispute between the two countries,” etc. Compare
Thucyd. v, 42, about the border territory round Panaktum.</p>

<p id="Footnote_125"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_125">[125]</a></span> Thucydidês (i, 139), in
assigning the reasons of this sentence of exclusion passed by
Athens against the Megarians, mentions only the two allegations
here noticed,—wrongful cultivation of territory, and reception of
runaway slaves. He does not allude to the herald, Anthemokritus:
still less does he notice that gossip of the day, which Aristophanês
and other comedians of this period turn to account in fastening the
Peloponnesian war upon the personal sympathies of Periklês, namely,
that first, some young men of Athens stole away the courtezan,
Simætha, from Megara: next, the Megarian youth revenged themselves
by stealing away from Athens “two engaging courtezans,” one of whom
was the mistress of Periklês; upon which the latter was so enraged
that he proposed the sentence of exclusion against the Megarians
(Aristoph. Acharn. 501-516; Plutarch, Periklês, c. 30).</p>

<p>Such stories are chiefly valuable as they make us acquainted with
the political scandal of the time. But the story of the herald,
Anthemokritus, and his death, cannot be altogether rejected. Though
Thucydidês, not mentioning the fact, did not believe that the
herald’s death had really been occasioned by the Megarians; yet
there probably was a popular belief at Athens to that effect, under
the influence of which the deceased herald received a public burial
near the Thriasian gate of Athens, leading to Eleusis: see Philippi
Epistol. ad Athen. ap. Demosthen. p. 159, R.; Pausan. i, 36, 3;
iii, 4, 2. The language of Plutarch (Periklês, c. 30) is probably
literally correct,—“the herald’s death <i>appeared</i> to have been caused
by the Megarians,”—αἰτίᾳ τῶν Μεγαρέων ἀποθανεῖν ἔδοξε. That neither
Thucydidês, nor Periklês himself, believed that the Megarians had
really caused his death, is pretty certain: otherwise, the fact
would have been urged when the Lacedæmonians sent to complain of the
sentence of exclusion,—being a deed so notoriously repugnant to all
Grecian feeling.</p>

here alluded to is, not the thirty years’ truce, concluded fourteen
years before the period actually present, but the ancient alliance
against the Persians, solemnly ratified and continued after the
victory of Platæa. Dr. Arnold, on the contrary, thinks that the
thirty years’ truce is alluded to, which the Æginetans interpreted
(rightly or not) as entitling them to independence.</p>

<p>The former opinion might seem to be countenanced by the allusion
to Ægina in the speech of the Thebans (iii, 64): but on the other
hand, if we consult i, 115, it will appear possible that the wording
of the thirty years’ truce may have been general, as,—Ἀποδοῦναι δὲ
Ἀθηναίους ὅσα ἔχουσι Πελοποννησίων: at any rate, the Æginetans may
have pretended that, by the same rule as Athens gave up Nisæa, Pegæ,
etc., she ought also to renounce Ægina.</p>

<p>However, we must recollect that the one plea does not exclude the
other: the Æginetans may have taken advantage of <i>both</i> in enforcing
their prayer for interference. This seems to have been the idea of
the Scholiast, when he says—κατὰ τὴν συμφωνίαν τῶν σπονδῶν.</p>

<p>The wording of this part of the speech of Archidamus is awkward
and obscure, though we make out pretty well the general sense.
It deserves peculiar attention, as coming from a king of Sparta,
personally, too, a man of superior judgment. The great points of the
Spartan character are all brought out. 1. A narrow, strictly-defined,
and uniform range of ideas. 2. Compression of all other impulses and
desires, but an increased sensibility to their own public opinion. 3.
Great habits of endurance as well as of submission.</p>

<p>The way in which the features of Spartan character are deduced
from Spartan institutions, as well as the pride which Archidamus
expresses in the ignorance and narrow mental range of his countrymen,
are here remarkable. A similar championship of ignorance and
narrow-mindedness is not only to be found among those who deride
the literary and oratorical tastes of the Athenian democracy (see
Aristophanês, Ran. 1070: compare Xenophon, Memorab. i, 2, 9-49), but
also in the speech of Kleon (Thucyd. iii, 37).</p>

<p>I conceive that the word <em class="gesperrt">ὁμοίως</em> here
alludes to the equal interest of all the confederates in the quarrel,
as opposed to the Athenian power, which was composed partly of
constrained subjects, partly of hired mercenaries: to both of which
points, as weaknesses in the enemy, the Corinthian orator goes on to
allude. The word ὁμοίως here designates the same fact as Periklês,
in his speech at Athens (i, 141), mentions under the words πάντες
ἰσόψηφοι: the Corinthian orator treats it as an advantage to have
all confederates equal and hearty in the cause: Periklês, on the
contrary, looking at the same fact from the Athenian point of view,
considers it as a disadvantage, since it prevented unity of command
and determination.</p>

<p id="Footnote_158"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_158">[158]</a></span> Plutarch’s biography of
Periklês is very misleading, from its inattention to chronology,
ascribing to an earlier time feelings and tendencies which really
belong to a later. Thus he represents (c. 20) the desire for
acquiring possession of Sicily, and even of Carthage and the
Tyrrhenian coast, as having become very popular at Athens even before
the revolt of Megara and Eubœa, and before those other circumstances
which preceded the thirty years’ truce: and he gives much credit
to Periklês for having repressed such unmeasured aspirations. But
ambitious hopes directed towards Sicily could not have sprung up in
the Athenian mind until after the beginning of the Peloponnesian war.
It was impossible that they could make any step in that direction
until they had established their alliance with Korkyra, and this was
only done in the year before the Peloponnesian war,—done too, even
then, in a qualified manner, and with much reserve. At the first
outbreak of the Peloponnesian war, the Athenians had nothing but
fears, while the Peloponnesians had large hopes of aid, from the
side of Sicily. While it is very true, therefore, that Periklês was
eminently useful in discouraging rash and distant enterprises of
ambition generally, we cannot give him the credit of keeping down
Athenian desires of acquisition in Sicily, or towards Carthage,—if,
indeed, this latter ever was included in the catalogue of Athenian
hopes,—for such desires were hardly known until after his death, in
spite of the assertion again repeated by Plutarch, Alkibiadês, c.
17.</p>

Respecting Aspasia, see Plato, Menexenus, c. 3, 4; Xenophon, Memorab.
ii, 6, 36; Harpokration, v, Ἀσπασία. Aspasia was, doubtless, not an
uncommon name among Grecian women; we know of one Phokæan girl who
bore it, the mistress of Cyrus the younger (Plutarch, Artaxer. c.
26). The story about Aspasia having kept slave-girls for hire, is
stated by both Plutarch and Athenæus (xiii, p. 570); but we may well
doubt whether there is any better evidence for it than that which is
actually cited by the latter, the passage in Aristophanês, Acharn.
497-505:—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Κἀθ᾽ οἱ Μεγαρῆς ὀδύναις πεφυσιγγωμένοι</p>
<p class="i0">Ἀντεξέκλεψαν Ἀσπασίας <em class="gesperrt">πόρνα δύο</em> or <em class="gesperrt">πόρνας δύο</em>.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="mt1">Athenæus reads the latter, but the reading πόρνα δύο
appears in the received text of Aristophanês. Critics differ, whether
Ἀσπασίας is the genitive case singular of Ἀσπασία, or the accusative
plural of the adjective ἀσπάσιος. I believe that it is the latter;
but intended as a play on the word, capable of being understood
either as a substantive or as an adjective—ἀσπασίας πόρνας δύο, or
Ἀσπασίας πόρνας δύο. There is a similar play on the word, in a line
of Kratinus, quoted by Plutarch, Periklês, c. 24.</p>

<p>At the time, if ever, when this theft of the Megarian youth took
place, Aspasia must have been the beloved mistress and companion
of Periklês; and it is inconceivable that she should have kept
slave-girls for hire <i>then</i>, whatever she may have done before.</p>

<p>That reading and construction of the verse above cited, which
I think the least probable of the two, has been applied by the
commentators of Thucydidês to explain a line of his history, and
applied in a manner which I am persuaded is erroneous. When the
Lacedæmonians desired the Athenians to repeal the decree excluding
the Megarians from their ports, the Athenians refused, alleging that
the Megarians had appropriated some lands which were disputed between
the two countries, and some which were even sacred property,—and
also, that “<i>they had received runaway slaves from Athens</i>,”—καὶ
ἀνδραπόδων ὑποδοχὴν τῶν ἀφισταμένων (i, 139). The Scholiast gives a
perfectly just explanation of these last words—ὡς ὅτι δούλους αὐτῶν
ἀποφεύγοντας ἐδέχοντο. But Wasse puts a note to the passage to this
effect—“<i>Aspasiæ servos</i>, v, Athenæum, p. 570; Aristoph. Acharn.
525, et Schol.” This note of Wasse is adopted and transcribed by the
three best and most recent commentators on Thucydidês,—Poppo, Göller,
and Dr. Arnold. Yet, with all respect to their united authority,
the supposition is neither natural, as applied to the words, nor
admissible, as regards the matter of fact. Ἀνδράποδα ἀφιστάμενα mean
naturally (not <i>Aspasiæ servos</i>, or more properly <i>servas</i>, for the
very gender ought to have made Wasse suspect the correctness of his
interpretation,—but) the runaway slaves of proprietors generally in
Attica; of whom the Athenians lost so prodigious a number after the
Lacedæmonian garrison was established at Dekeleia (Thucyd. vii, 28:
compare i, 142; and iv, 118, about the ἀυτόμολοι). Periklês might
well set forth the reception of such runaway slaves as a matter of
complaint against the Megarians, and the Athenian public assembly
would feel it so likewise: moreover, the Megarians are charged, not
with having <i>stolen away</i> the slaves, but with <i>harboring</i> them
(ὑποδοχὴν). But to suppose that Periklês, in defending the decree
of exclusion against the Megarians, would rest the defence on the
ground that some Megarian youth had run away with two girls of the
<i>cortège</i> of Aspasia, argues a strange conception both of him and of
the people. If such an incident ever really happened, or was even
supposed to have happened, we may be sure that it would be cited
by his opponents, as a means of bringing contempt upon the real
accusation against the Megarians,—the purpose for which Aristophanês
produces it. This is one of the many errors in respect to Grecian
history, arising from the practice of construing passages of comedy
as if they were serious and literal facts.</p>

on the two passages of Aristophanês; Plutarch, Periklês, c. 32.</p>

<p>Diodorus (as well as Plutarch, Alkibiad. c. 7) relates another
tale, that Alkibiadês once approached Periklês when he was in
evident low spirits and embarrassment, and asked him the reason:
Periklês told him that the time was near at hand for rendering his
accounts, and that he was considering how this could be done: upon
which Alkibiadês advised him to consider rather how he could evade
doing it. The result of this advice was that Periklês plunged Athens
into the Peloponnesian war: compare Aristophan. Nub. 855, with the
Scholia,—and Ephorus, Fragm. 118, 119, ed. Marx, with the notes of
Marx.</p>

<p>It is probable enough that Ephorus copied the story, which
ascribes the Peloponnesian war to the accusations against Pheidias
and Periklês, from Aristophanês or other comic writers of the
time. But it deserves remark, that even Aristophanês is not to be
considered as certifying it. For if we consult the passage above
referred to in his comedy <i>Pax</i>, we shall find that, first, Hermês
tells the story about Pheidias, Periklês, and the Peloponnesian war;
upon which both Trygæus, and the Chorus, remark that <i>they never
heard a word of it before</i>: that it is quite <i>new</i> to them.</p>

Damon, the personal friend and instructor of Periklês, must have
been banished at a time when Periklês was old,—perhaps somewhere
near about this time. The passage in Plato, Alkibiadês, i, c.
30, p. 118, proves that Damon was in Athens, and intimate with
Periklês, when the latter was of considerable age—καὶ νῦν ἔτι <em

appears, from the words of Thucydidês, that these various demands of
the Lacedæmonians were made by <i>one</i> embassy, joined by new members
arriving with fresh instructions, but remaining during a month or six
weeks, between January and March 431 <small>B.C.</small>,

introduces into this sentence, and which seems to have been agreeable

sense by no means common,—“in a manner which cannot be learned,
departing from all reasonable calculation.” Ἀμαθῶς, when referred to
διανοίας, bears its usual meaning,—“ignorant, deficient in learning
or in reason.”</p>

and winter are each a half of the year (Thucyd. v, 20), though Poppo
erroneously treats the Thucydidean winter as only four months (Poppo,

<p id="Footnote_203"><span class="label"><a

ἀνεῖπεν ὁ κήρυξ, εἴτις βούλεται κατὰ τὰ πάτρια τῶν πάντων Βοιωτῶν
ξυμμαχεῖν, <em class="gesperrt">τίθεσθαι παρ᾽ αὑτοὺς τὰ ὅπλα</em>.</p>

<p>Dr. Arnold has a note upon this passage, explaining τίθεσθαι, or
θέσθαι τὰ ὅπλα, to mean, “piling the arms,” or getting rid of their
spears and shields by piling them all in one or more heaps. He says:
“The Thebans, therefore, as usual on a halt, proceeded to pile their
arms, and by inviting the Platæans to come and pile theirs with
them, they meant that they should come in arms from their several
houses to join them, and thus naturally pile their spears and shields
with those of their friends, to be taken up together with theirs,
whenever there should be occasion either to march or to fight.” The
same explanation of the phrase had before been given by Wesseling
and Larcher, ad Herodot. ix, 52; though Bähr on the passage is more
satisfactory.</p>

<p>Both Poppo and Göller also sanction Dr. Arnold’s explanation: yet
I cannot but think that it is unsuitable to the passage before us, as
well as to several other passages in which τίθεσθαι τὰ ὅπλα occurs:
there may be other passages in which it will suit, but as a general
explanation it appears to me inadmissible. In most cases, the words
mean “<i>armati consistere</i>,”—to ground arms,—to maintain rank, resting
the spear and shield (see Xenoph. Hellen. ii, 4, 12) upon the ground.
In the incident now before us, the Theban hoplites enter Platæa,
a strange town, with the population decidedly hostile, and likely
to be provoked more than ever by this surprise, add to which, that
it is pitch dark, and a rainy night. Is it likely, that the first
thing which they do will be to pile their arms? The darkness alone
would render it a slow and uncertain operation to resume the arms:
so that when the Platæans attacked them, as they did, quite suddenly
and unexpectedly, and while it was yet dark, the Thebans would
have been—upon Dr. Arnold’s supposition—altogether defenceless and
unarmed (see ii, 3. <em class="gesperrt">προσέβαλόν τε εὐθὺς</em>—οἱ
Πλαταιῆς—καὶ ἐς χεῖρας ᾔεσαν <em class="gesperrt">κατὰ τάχος</em>)
which certainly they were not. Dr. Arnold’s explanation may suit
the case of the soldier in camp, but certainly not that of the
soldier in presence of an enemy, or under circumstances of danger:
the difference of the two will be found illustrated in Xenophon,
Hellenic. ii, 4, 5, 6.</p> <p>Nor do the passages referred to by Dr.
Arnold himself bear out his interpretation of the phrase τίθεσθαι τὰ
ὅπλα. That interpretation is, moreover, not conveniently applicable
either to Thucyd. vii, 3, or viii, 25,—decidedly inapplicable to iv,
68 (θησόμενον τὰ ὅπλα), in the description of the night attack on
Megara, very analogous to this upon Platæa,—and not less decidedly
inapplicable to two passages of Xenophon’s Anabasis, i, 5, 14; iv, 3,
7.</p>

<p>Schneider, in the Lexicon appended to his edition of Xenophon’s
Anabasis, has a long but not very distinct article upon τίθεσθαι τὰ
ὅπλα.</p>

<p>I may be permitted to illustrate this by a short extract from
the letter of M. Marrast, mayor of Paris, to the National Assembly,
written during the formidable insurrection of June 25, 1848, in that
city, and describing the proceedings of the insurgents: “Dans la
plupart des rues longues, étroites et couvertes de barricades qui
vont de l’Hôtel de Ville à la Rue St. Antoine, la garde nationale
mobile, et la troupe de ligne, ont dû faire le siège de chaque
maison; et ce qui rendait l’œuvre plus périlleuse, c’est que les
insurgés avaient établi, de chaque maison à chaque maison, des
communications intérieures qui reliaient les maisons entre elles,
en sorte qu’ils pouvaient se rendre, comme par une allée couverte,
d’un point éloigné jusqu’au centre d’une suite de barricades qui les
protégeaient.” (Lettre publiée dans le journal, le National, June 26,
1848).</p>

vii, 233. Demosthenês (cont. Neæram, c. 25, p. 1379) agrees with
Thucydidês in the statement that the Platæans slew their prisoners.
From whom Diodorus borrowed his inadmissible story, that the Platæans
gave up their prisoners to the Thebans, I cannot tell (Diodor. xii,
41, 42).</p>

<p>The passage in this oration against Neæra is also curious, both
as it agrees with Thucydidês on many points, and as it differs from
him on several others: in some sentences, even the words agree
with Thucydidês (ὁ γὰρ Ἀσωπὸς ποταμὸς μέγας ἐῤῥύη, καὶ διαβῆναι οὐ
ῥᾴδιον ἦν, etc.: compare Thucyd. ii, 2); while on other points there
is discrepancy. Demosthenês—or the Pseudo-Demosthenês—states that
Archidamus, king of Sparta, planned the surprise of Platæa,—that
the Platæans only discovered, when morning dawned, the small real
number of the Thebans in the town,—that the larger body of Thebans,
when they at last did arrive near Platæa after the great delay in
their march, were forced to retire by the numerous force arriving
from Athens, and that the Platæans then destroyed their prisoners in
the town. Demosthenês mentions nothing about any convention between
the Platæans and the Thebans without the town, respecting the Theban
prisoners within.</p>

<p>On every point on which the narrative of Thucydidês differs from
that of Demosthenês, that of the former stands out as the most
coherent and credible.</p>

<p>Thucydidês then proceeds to give an explanation of his own for
this ancient prophecy, intended to save its credit, as well as to
show that his countrymen had not, as some persons alleged, violated
any divine mandate by admitting residents into the Pelasgikon. When
the oracle said: “The Pelasgikon is better unoccupied,” it did not
mean to interdict the occupation of that spot, but to foretell that
it would never be occupied until a time of severe calamity arrived.
The necessity of occupying it grew only out of national suffering.
Such is the explanation suggested by Thucydidês.</p>

feeble Λόγος Ἐπιτάφιος, ascribed to Demosthenês, to be not really
his. Of those ascribed to Plato and Lysias also, the genuineness has
been suspected, though upon far less grounds. The Menexenus, if it
be really the work of Plato, however, does not add to his fame: but
the harangue of Lysias, a very fine composition, may well be his,
and may, perhaps, have been really delivered,—though probably not
delivered by him, as he was not a qualified citizen.</p>

<p>See the general instructions, in Dionys. Hal. Ars Rhetoric. c.
6, pp. 258-268, Reisk, on the contents and composition of a funeral
discourse,—Lysias is said to have composed several,—Plutarch, Vit. x,

<p>Dahlmann (Historische Forschungen, vol. i, p. 23) seems to think
that the original oration of Periklês contained a large sprinkling
of mythical allusions and stories out of the antiquities of Athens,
such as we now find in the other funeral orations above alluded to;
but that Thucydidês himself deliberately left them out in his report.
But there seems no foundation for this suspicion. It is much more
consonant to the superior tone of dignity which reigns throughout all
this oration, to suppose that the mythical narratives, and even the
previous historical glories of Athens, never found any special notice
in the speech of Periklês,—nothing more than a general recognition,
with an intimation that he does not dwell upon them at length because
they were well known to his audience,—μακρηγορεῖν ἐν εἰδόσιν οὐ

<p id="Footnote_270"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_270">[270]</a></span> The remarks of Dionysius
Halikarnassus, tending to show that the number of dead buried on
this occasion was so small, and the actions in which they had
been slain so insignificant, as to be unworthy of so elaborate an
harangue as this of Periklês,—and finding fault with Thucydidês on
that ground,—are by no means well-founded or justifiable. He treats
Thucydidês like a dramatic writer putting a speech into the mouth of
one of his characters, and he considers that the occasion chosen for
this speech was unworthy. But though this assumption would be correct
with regard to many ancient historians, and to Dionysius himself in
his Roman history,—it is not correct with reference to Thucydidês.
The speech of Periklês was a real speech, heard, reproduced, and
doubtless dressed up, by Thucydidês: if therefore more is said than
the number of the dead or the magnitude of the occasion warranted,
this is the fault of Periklês, and not of Thucydidês. Dionysius says
that there were many other occasions throughout the war much more
worthy of an elaborate funeral harangue,—especially the disastrous
loss of the Sicilian army. But Thucydidês could not have heard any
of them, after his exile in the eighth year of the war: and we may
well presume that none of them would bear any comparison with this of
Periklês. Nor does Dionysius at all appreciate the full circumstances
of this first year of the war,—which, when completely felt, will
be found to render the splendid and copious harangue of the great
statesman eminently seasonable. See Dionys. H. de Thucyd. Judic. pp.

Athenians, though their persons and movable property were crowded
within the walls, had not driven in their sheep and cattle also,
but had transported them over to Eubœa and the neighboring islands
(Thucyd. ii, 14). Hence they escaped a serious aggravation of their
epidemic: for in the accounts of the epidemics which desolated Rome
under similar circumstances, we find the accumulation of great
numbers of cattle, along with human beings, specified as a terrible
addition to the calamity (see Livy, iii, 66; Dionys. Hal. Ant. Rom.

(observes M. Littré, in his introduction to the works of Hippokratês,
tom. i, p. 122), est tellement bonne qu’elle suffit pleinement pour
nous faire comprendre ce que cette ancienne maladie a été: et il
est fort à regretter que des médecins tels qu’Hippocrate et Galien
n’aient rien écrit sur les grandes épidémies, dont ils ont été les
spectateurs. Hippocrate a été témoin de cette peste racontée par
Thucydide, et il ne nous en a pas laissé la description. Galien vit
également la fièvre éruptive qui désola le monde sous Marc Aurèle, et
qu’il appelle lui-même la longue peste. Cependant excepté quelques
mots épars dans ses volumineux ouvrages, excepté quelques indications
fugitives, il ne nous a rien transmis sur un événement médical
aussi important; à tel point que si nous n’avions pas le récit de
Thucydide, il nous seroit fort difficile de nous faire une idée de
celle qu’a vue Galien, et qui est la même (comme M. Hecker s’est
attaché à le démontrer) que la maladie connue sous le nom de Peste
d’Athènes. C’était une fièvre éruptive différente de la variole, et
éteinte aujourdhui. On a cru en voir les traces dans les <i>charbons</i>
(ἄνθρακες) des livres Hippocratiques.”</p>

<p>Both Krauss (Disquisitio de naturâ morbi Atheniensium. Stuttgard,
1831, p. 38) and Hæser (Historisch. Patholog. Untersuchungen. Dresden
1839, p. 50) assimilate the pathological phenomena specified by
Thucydidês to different portions of the Ἐπιδημίαι of Hippokratês.
M. Littré thinks that the resemblance is not close or precise, so
as to admit of the one being identified with the other. “Le tableau
si frappant qu’en a tracé ce grand historien ne se réproduit pas
certainement avec une netteté suffisante dans les brefs détails
donnés par Hippocrate. La maladie d’Athènes avoit un type si tranché,
que tous ceux qui en ont parlé ont du le réproduire dans ses parties
essentielles.” (Argument aux 2<sup>me</sup> Livre des Epidémies,
Œuvres d’Hippocrate, tom. v. p. 64.) There appears good reason to
believe that the great epidemic which prevailed in the Roman world
under Marcus Aurelius—the Pestis Antoniniana—was a renewal of what is
called the Plague of Athens.</p>

<p>Demokritus, among others, connected the generation of these
epidemics with his general system of atoms, atmospheric effluvia,
and εἴδωλα: see Plutarch, Symposiac. viii, 9, p. 733; Demokriti
Fragment., ed. Mullach, lib. iv, p. 409.</p>

<p>The causes of the Athenian epidemic as given by Diodorus (xii,
58)—unusual rains, watery quality of grain, absence of the Etesian
winds, etc., may perhaps be true of the revival of the epidemic
in the fifth year of the war, but can hardly be true of its first
appearance; since Thucydidês states that the year in other respects
was unusually healthy, and the epidemic was evidently brought from
foreign parts to Peiræus.</p>

<p>In proof how rare the conception was, in ancient times, of the
importance of collecting and registering particular medical facts,
I transcribe the following observations from M. Littré (Œuvres
d’Hippocrate, tom. iv, p. 646, Remarques Retrospectives).</p>

<p>“Toutefois ce qu’il importe ici de constater, ce n’est pas
qu’Hippocrate a observé de telle ou telle manière, mais c’est qu’il
a eu l’idée de recueillir et de consigner des faits particuliers.
En effet, rien, dans l’antiquité, n’a été plus rare que ce soin:
outre Hippocrate, je ne connois qu’Erasistrate qui se soit occupé de
relater sous cette forme les résultats de son expérience clinique.
Ni Galien lui-même, ni Arétée, ni Soranus, ni les autres qui sont
arrivés jusqu’à nous, n’ont suivi un aussi louable exemple. Les
observations consignées dans la collection Hippocratique constituent
la plus grande partie, à beaucoup près, de ce que l’antiquité a
possédé en ce genre: et si, en commentant le travail d’Hippocrate, on
l’avait un peu imité, nous aurions des matériaux à l’aide desquels
nous prendrions une idée bien plus précise de la pathologie de
ces siècles reculés.... Mais tout en exprimant ce regret et en
reconnaissant cette utilité relative à nous autres modernes et
véritablement considérable, il faut ajouter que l’antiquité avoit
dans les faits et la doctrine Hippocratiques un aliment qui lui a
suffi—et qu’une collection, même étendue, d’histoires particulières
n’auroit pas alors modifié la médecine, du moins la médecine
scientifique, essentiellement et au delà de la limite que comportoit
la physiologie. Je pourrai montrer ailleurs que la doctrine
d’Hippocrate et de l’école de Cos a été la seule solide, la seule
fondée sur un aperçu vrai de la nature organisée; et que les sectes
postérieures, méthodisme et pneumatisme, n’ont bâti leurs théories
que sur des hypothèses sans consistance. Mais ici je me contente de
remarquer, que la pathologie, en tant que science, ne peut marcher
qu’à la suite de la physiologie, dont elle n’est qu’une des faces: et
d’Hippocrate à Galien inclusivement, la physiologie ne fit pas assez
de progrès pour rendre insuffisante la conception Hippocratique. Il
en résulte, nécessairement, que la pathologie, toujours considérée
comme science, n’auroit pu, par quelque procédé que ce fût, gagner
que des corrections et des augmentations de détail.”</p>

<p>Some of the ancient physicians were firm believers in the efficacy
of these charms and incantations. Alexander of Tralles says, that
having originally treated them with contempt, he had convinced
himself of their value by personal observation, and altered his
opinion (ix, 4)—ἔνιοι γοῦν οἴονται τοῖς τῶν γραῶν μύθοις ἐοικέναι

<p class="mt1">See also the first among the epistles ascribed to the

<p>It appears that there was a debate whether, in this Hexameter
verse, λιμὸς (famine) or λοιμὸς (pestilence) was the correct reading:
and the probability is, that it had been originally composed with
the word λιμὸς,—for men might well fancy beforehand that <i>famine</i>
would be a sequel of the Dorian war, but they would not be likely
to imagine <i>pestilence</i> as accompanying it. Yet, says Thucydidês,
the reading λοιμὸς was held decidedly preferable, as best fitting to
the actual circumstances (οἱ γὰρ ἄνθρωποι πρὸς ἃ ἔπασχον τὴν μνήμην
ἐποιοῦντο). And “if (he goes on to say) there should ever hereafter
come another Dorian war, and famine along with it, the oracle will
probably be reproduced with the word λιμὸς as part of it.”</p>

<p>This deserves notice, as illustrating the sort of admitted license
with which men twisted the oracles or prophecies, so as to hit the
feelings of the actual moment.</p>

<p id="Footnote_297"><span class="label"><a

p. 515, c. 71: Plutarch, Periklês, c. 35; Diodor. xii, c. 38-45.
About Simmias, as the vehement enemy of Periklês, see Plutarch,
Reipub. Ger. Præcept. p. 805.</p>

<p>Plutarch and Diodorus both state that Periklês was not only fined,
but also removed from his office of stratêgus. Thucydidês mentions
the fine, but not the removal: and his silence leads me to doubt
the reality of the latter event altogether. For with such a man as
Periklês, a vote of removal would have been a penalty more marked and
cutting than the fine; moreover, removal from office, though capable
of being pronounced by vote of the public assembly, would hardly be
inflicted as penalty by the dikastery.</p>

<p>I imagine the events to have passed as follows: The stratêgi, with
most other officers of the commonwealth, were changed or reëlected at
the beginning of Hekatombæon, the first month of the Attic year; that
is, somewhere about midsummer. Now the Peloponnesian army, invading
Attica about the end of March or beginning of April, and remaining
forty days, would leave the country about the first week in May.
Periklês returned from his expedition against Peloponnesus shortly
after they left Attica; that is, about the middle of May (Thucyd. ii,
57): there still remained, therefore, a month or six weeks before his
office of stratêgus naturally expired, and required renewal. It was
during this interval (which Thucydidês expresses by the words ἔτι δ᾽
ἐστρατήγει, ii, 59) that he convoked the assembly and delivered the
harangue recently mentioned.</p>

<p>But when the time for a new election of stratêgi arrived, the
enemies of Periklês opposed his reëlection, and brought a charge
against him, in that trial of accountability to which every
magistrate at Athens was exposed, after his period of office.
They alleged against him some official misconduct in reference to
the public money, and the dikastery visited him with a fine. His
reëlection was thus prevented, and with a man who had been so often
reëlected, this might be loosely called “taking away the office
of general:” so that the language of Plutarch and Diodorus, as
well as the silence of Thucydidês, would, on this supposition, be
justified.</p>

<p id="Footnote_320"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_320">[320]</a></span> Thucyd. ii. 67. Dr. Thirlwall
(Hist. Greece, vol. iii, ch. 20, p. 129) says that “the envoys
were sacrificed chiefly to give a decent color to the baseness” of
killing Aristeus, from whom the Athenians feared subsequent evil,
in consequence of his ability and active spirit. I do not think
this is fairly contained in the words of Thucydidês. He puts in the
foreground of Athenian motive, doubtless, fear from the future energy
of Aristeus; but if that had been the only motive, the Athenians
would probably have slain him singly without the rest: they would
hardly think it necessary to provide themselves with “any decent
color,” in the way that Dr. Thirlwall suggests. Thucydidês names the
special feeling of the Athenians against Aristeus (in my judgment),
chiefly in order to explain the extreme haste of the Athenian
sentence of execution—αὐθήμερον—ἀκρίτους, etc.: they were under the
influence of combined motives,—fear, revenge, retaliation.</p>

<p>The envoys here slain were sons of Sperthiês and Bulis, former
Spartan heralds who had gone up to Xerxes at Susa to offer their
heads as atonement for the previous conduct of the Spartans in
killing the heralds of Darius. Xerxes dismissed them unhurt,—so that
the anger of Talthybius (the heroic progenitor of the family of
heralds at Sparta) remained still unsatisfied: it was only satisfied
by the death of their two sons, now slain by the Athenians. The fact
that the two persons now slain were sons of those two (Sperthiês and
Bulis) who had previously gone to Susa to tender their lives,—is
spoken of as a “romantic and tragical coincidence.” But there
surely is very little to wonder at. The functions of herald at
Sparta, were the privilege of a particular gens, or family: every
herald, therefore, was <i>ex officio</i> the son of a herald. Now when
the Lacedæmonians, at the beginning of this Peloponnesian war, were
looking out for two members of the heraldic gens to send up to Susa,
upon whom would they so naturally fix as upon the sons of those two
men who had been to Susa before? These sons had doubtless heard
their fathers talk a great deal about it,—probably with interest and
satisfaction, since they derived great glory from the unaccepted
offer of their lives in atonement. There was a particular reason
why these two men should be taken, in preference to any other
heralds, to fulfil this dangerous mission: and doubtless when they
perished in it, the religious imagination of the Lacedæmonians would
group all the series of events as consummation of the judgment
inflicted by Talthybius in his anger (Herodot. vii, 135—ὡς λέγουσι
Λακεδαιμόνιοι).</p>

<p>It appears that Anêristus, the herald here slain, had
distinguished himself personally in that capture of fishermen on the
coast of Peloponnesus by the Lacedæmonians, for which the Athenians
were now retaliating (Herodot. vii, 137). Though this passage of
Herodotus is not clear, yet the sense here put upon it is the natural
one,—and clearer (in my judgment) than that which O. Müller would
propose instead of it (Dorians, ii, p. 437).</p>

πορθμόν.</p>

<p>There is considerable difficulty in clearly understanding what
was here done, especially what is meant by the words οὐκ ἔλαθον
νυκτὸς ὐφορμισάμενοι, which words the Scholiast construed as if the
nominative case to ἔλαθον were οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι, whereas the natural
structure of the sentence, as well as the probabilities of fact, lead
the best commentators to consider οἱ Πελοποννήσιοι as the nominative
case to that verb. The remark of the Scholiast, however, shows us,
that the difficulty of understanding the sentence dates from ancient
times.</p>

<p>Dr. Arnold—whose explanation is adopted by Poppo and Göller—says:
“The two fleets were moving parallel to one another along the
opposite shores of the Corinthian gulf. But even when they had sailed
out of the strait at Rhium, the opposite shores were still so near,
that the Peloponnesians hoped to cross over without opposition,
if they could so far deceive the Athenians, as to the spot where
they brought to for the night, as to induce them either to stop
too soon, or to advance too far, that they might not be exactly
opposite to them to intercept the passage. If they could lead the
Athenians to think that they meant to advance in the night beyond
Patræ, the Athenian fleet was likely to continue its own course along
the northern shore, to be ready to intercept them when they should
endeavor to run across to Acarnania. But the Athenians, aware that
they had stopped at Patræ, stopped themselves at Chalkis, instead of
proceeding further to the westward; and thus were so nearly opposite
to them, that the Peloponnesians had not time to get more than
half-way across, before they found themselves encountered by their
watchful enemy.”</p>

<p>This explanation seems to me not satisfactory, nor does it take
account of all the facts of the case. The first belief of the
Peloponnesians was, that Phormio would not dare to attack them at
all: accordingly, having arrived at Patræ, they stretched from thence
across the gulf to the mouth of the Euenus,—the natural way of
proceeding according to ancient navigation,—going in the direction
of Akarnania (ἐπὶ Ἀκαρνανίας). As they were thus stretching across,
they perceived Phormio bearing down upon them from the Euenus: this
was a surprise to them, and as they wished to avoid a battle in the
mid-channel, they desisted from proceeding farther that day, in hopes
to be able to deceive Phormio in respect of their night-station.
They made a feint of taking night-station on the shore between Patræ
and Rhium, near the narrow part of the strait; but, in reality, they
“slipped anchor and put to sea during the night,” as Mr. Bloomfield
says, in hopes of getting across the shorter passage under favor of
darkness, before Phormio could come upon them. That they must have
done this is proved by the fact, that the subsequent battle was
fought on the morrow in the mid-channel <i>very little after daybreak</i>
(we learn this from what Thucydidês says about the gulf-breeze,
for which Phormio waited before he would commence his attack—ὅπερ
ἀναμένων τε περιέπλει, καὶ εἰώθει γίγνεσθαι <em class="gesperrt">ἐπι
τὴν ἕω</em>). If Phormio had returned to Chalkis, they would probably
have succeeded; but he must have kept the sea all night, which would
be the natural proceeding of a vigilant captain, determined not to
let the Peloponnesians get across without fighting: so that he was
upon them in the mid-channel immediately that day broke.</p>

<p>Putting all the statements of Thucydidês together, we may be
convinced that this is the way in which the facts occurred. But of
the precise sense of ὐφορμισάμενοι, I confess I do not feel certain:
Haack says, it means “clam appellere ad littus,” but here, I think,
that sense will not do: for the Peloponnesians did not wish, and
could indeed hardly hope, to conceal from Phormio the spot where
they brought to for the night, and to make him suppose that they
brought to at some point of the shore west of Patræ, when in reality
they passed the night in Patræ,—which is what Dr. Arnold supposes.
The shore west of Patræ makes a bend to the southwest,—forming the
gulf of Patras,—so that the distance from the northern, or Ætolian
and Akarnanian, side of the gulf becomes for a considerable time
longer and longer, and the Peloponnesians would thus impose upon
themselves a longer crossing, increasing the difficulty of getting
over without a battle. But ὐφορμισάμενοι may reasonably be supposed
to mean, especially in conjunction with οὐκ ἔλαθον, “taking up a
simulated or imperfect night-station,” in which they did not really
intend to stay all night, and which could be quitted at short notice
and with ease. The preposition ὑπὸ, in composition, would thus have
the sense, not of <i>secrecy</i> (<i>clam</i>) but of <i>sham-performance</i>, or
of mere going through the forms of an act for the purpose of making
a false impression (like ὑποφέρειν, Xenoph. Hell. iv, 72). Mr.
Bloomfield proposes conjecturally ἀφορμισάμενοι, meaning, “that the
Peloponnesians slipped their anchors in the night:” I place no faith
in the conjecture, but I believe him to be quite right in supposing,
that the Peloponnesians <i>did actually</i> slip their anchors in the
night.</p>

<p>Another point remains to be adverted to. The battle took place
κατὰ μέσον τὸν πορθμόν. Now we need not understand this expression
to allude to the narrowest part of the sea, or the strait, strictly
and precisely; that is, the line of seven stadia between Rhium and
Antirrhium. But I think we must understand it to mean a portion of
sea not far westward of the strait, where the breadth, though greater
than that of the strait itself, is yet not so great as it becomes in
the line drawn northward from Patræ. We cannot understand πορθμὸς
(as Mr. Bloomfield and Poppo do,—see the note of the latter on the
Scholia) to mean <i>trajectus</i> simply, that is to say, the passage
across even the widest portion of the gulf of Patras: nor does the
passage cited out of c. 86 require us so to understand it. Πορθμὸς,
in Thucydidês, means a strait, or narrow crossing of sea, and Poppo
himself admits that Thucydidês always uses it so: nor would it be
reasonable to believe that he would call the line of sea across the
gulf, from Patræ to the mouth of the Euenus, a πορθμός. See the note
of Göller, on this point.</p>

διέκπλουν. The great object of the fast-sailing Athenian trireme
was, to drive its beak against some weak part of the adversary’s
ship: the stern, the side, or the oars,—not against the beak, which
was strongly constructed as well for defence as for offence. The
Athenian, therefore, rowing through the intervals of the adversary’s
line, and thus getting in their rear, turned rapidly, and got the
opportunity, before the ship of the adversary could change its
position, of striking it either in the stern or some weak part. Such
a manœuvre was called the <i>diekplus</i>. The success of it, of course,
depended upon the extreme rapidity and precision of the movements of
the Athenian vessel, so superior in this respect to its adversary,
not only in the better construction of the ship, but the excellence
of rowers and steersmen.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_341"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_341">[341]</a></span> See Dr. Arnold’s note upon this
passage of Thucydidês, respecting the keleustês and his functions: to
the passages which he indicates as reference, I will add two more of
Plautus, Mercat. iv, 2, 5, and Asinaria, iii, 1, 15.</p>

<p>When we conceive the structure of an ancient trireme, we shall at
once see, first, how essential the keleustês was, to keep the rowers
in harmonious action,—next, how immense the difference must have been
between practised and unpractised rowers. The trireme had, in all,
one hundred and seventy rowers, distributed into three tiers. The
upper tier, called thranitæ, were sixty-two in number, or thirty-one
on each side: the middle tier, or zygitæ, as well as the lowest
tier, or thalamitæ, were each fifty-four in number, or twenty-seven
on each side. Besides these, there were belonging to each trireme a
certain number, seemingly about thirty, of supplementary oars (κῶπαι
περινέω), to be used by the epibatæ, or soldiers, serving on board,
in case of rowers being killed, or oars broken. Each tier of rowers
was distributed along the whole length of the vessel, from head to
stern, or at least along the greater part of it; but the seats of
the higher tiers were not placed in the exact perpendicular line
above the lower. Of course, the oars of the thranitæ, or uppermost
tier, were the longest: those of the thalamitæ, or lowest tier, the
shortest: those of the zygitæ, of a length between the two. Each
oar was rowed only by one man. The thranitæ, as having the longest
oars, were most hardly worked and most highly paid. What the length
of the oars was, belonging to either tier, we do not know, but some
of the supplementary oars appear to have been about fifteen feet in
length.</p>

<p>What is here stated, appears to be pretty well ascertained,
chiefly from the inscriptions discovered at Athens a few years ago,
so full of information respecting the Athenian marine,—and from the
most instructive commentary appended to these inscriptions by M.
Boeckh, Seewesen der Athener, ch. ix, pp. 94, 104, 115. But there is
a great deal still, respecting the equipment of an ancient trireme,
unascertained and disputed.</p>

<p>Now there was nothing but the voice of the keleustês to keep these
one hundred and seventy rowers all to good time with their strokes.
With oars of different length, and so many rowers, this must have
been no easy matter, and apparently quite impossible, unless the
rowers were trained to act together. The difference between those
who were so trained and those who were not, must have been immense.
We may imagine the difference between the ships of Phormio and those
of his enemies, and the difficulty of the latter in contending with
the swell of the sea,—when we read this description of the ancient
trireme.</p>

<p>About two hundred men, that is to say, one hundred and seventy
rowers and thirty supernumeraries, mostly epibatæ or hoplites
serving on board, besides the pilot, the man at the ship’s bow,
the keleustês, etc., probably some half dozen officers, formed the
crew of a trireme: compare Herodot. viii, 17; vii, 184, where he
calculates the thirty epibatæ over and above the two hundred. Dr.
Arnold thinks that, at the beginning of the Peloponnesian war, the
epibatæ on board an Athenian trireme were no more than ten: but this
seems not quite made out: see his note on Thucyd. iii, 95.</p>

<p>The Venetian galleys in the thirteenth century were manned by
about the same number of men. “Les galères Vénitiens du convoi de
Flandre devaient être montées par deux cent hommes libres, dont 180
rameurs, et 12 archers. Les arcs ou balistes furent préscrits en 1333
pour toutes les galères de commerce armées.” (Depping, Histoire du
Commerce entre le Levant et l’Europe, vol. i, p. 163.)</p>

<p>It will be seen that I have represented in the text the movement
of the Peloponnesian fleet as directed ostensibly and to all
appearance against Naupaktus: and I translate the words in the fourth
line of the above passage—ἐπὶ τὴν ἑαυτῶν γῆν ἔσω ἐπὶ τοῦ κόλπου—as
meaning “<i>against the station of the Athenians up the gulf within</i>,”
that is, against Naupaktus. Mr. Bloomfield gives that meaning to the
passage, though not to the words; but the Scholiast, Dr. Arnold,
Poppo, and Göller, all construe it differently, and maintain that the
words τὴν ἐαυτῶν γῆν mean <i>the Peloponnesian shore</i>. To my view, this
latter interpretation renders the whole scheme of the battle confused
and unintelligible; while with the other meaning it is perfectly
clear, and all the circumstances fit in with each other.</p>

<p>Dr. Arnold does not seem even to admit that τὴν ἑαυτῶν γῆν can
mean anything else but the coast of Peloponnesus. He says: “The
Scholiast says that ἐπὶ is here used for παρά. It would be better
to say that it has a mixed signification of motion towards a place
and neighborhood to it: expressing that the Peloponnesians sailed
<i>towards</i> their own land (<i>i. e.</i> towards Corinth, Sikyon, and
Pellênê, to which places the greater number of the ships belonged),
instead of standing over to the opposite coast, which belonged to
their enemies: and at the same time kept close <i>upon</i> their own land,
in the sense of ἐπὶ with a dative case.”</p>

<p>It appears to me that Dr. Arnold’s supposition of Corinth and
Sikyon as the meaning of τὴν ἑαυτῶν γῆν is altogether far-fetched
and improbable. As a matter of fact, it would only be true of part
of the confederate fleet; while it would be false with regard to
ships from Elis, Leukas, etc. And if it had been true with regard
to all, yet the distance of Corinth from the Peloponnesian station
was so very great, that Thucydidês would hardly mark <i>direction</i> by
referring to a city so very far off. Then again, both the Scholiast
and Dr. Arnold do great violence to the meaning of the preposition
ἐπὶ with an accusative case, and cite no examples to justify it. What
the sense of ἐπὶ is with an accusative case signifying locality,
is shown by Thucydidês in this very passage.—εἰ ἄρα νομίσας <em
class="gesperrt">ἐπὶ τὴν Ναύπακτον</em> αὐτοὺς πλεῖν ὁ Φορμίων,
etc. (again, c. 85. ἐπὶ Κυδωνίαν πλεῦσαι; and i. 29, ἐπὶ Ἐπίδαμνον,
etc.—ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν αὐτοῦ of Perdikkas, i, 57), that is, against, or to
go thither with a hostile purpose. So sensible does the Scholiast
seem to be of this, that he affirms ἐπὶ to be used instead of παρά.
This is a most violent supposition, for nothing can be more different
than the two phrases ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν and παρὰ τὴν γῆν. Dr. Arnold again
assigns to ἐπὶ with an accusative case another sense, which he
himself admits that it only has with a dative.</p>

<p>I make these remarks with a view to show that the sense which Dr.
Arnold and others put upon the words of Thucydidês,—ἔπλεον ἐπὶ τὴν
ἑαυτῶν γῆν,—departs from the usual, and even from the legitimate
meaning of the words. But I have a stronger objection still. If
that sense be admitted, it will be found quite inconsistent with
the subsequent proceedings, as Thucydidês describes; and any one
who will look at the map in reading this chapter, will see plainly
that the fact is so. If, as Dr. Arnold supposes, the Peloponnesian
fleet kept close along the shore of Peloponnesus, what was there in
their movements to alarm Phormio for the safety of Naupaktus, or to
draw him so reluctantly into the strait? Or if we even grant this,
and suppose that Phormio construed the movement along the coast of
Achaia to indicate designs against Naupaktus, and that he therefore
came into the gulf and sailed along his own shore to defend the
town,—still the Peloponnesians would be separated from him by the
whole breadth of the gulf at that point; and as soon as they altered
their line of direction for the purpose of crossing the gulf and
attacking him, he would have the whole breadth of the gulf in which
to take his measures for meeting them, so that instead of finding
himself jammed up against the land, he would have been able to go
out and fight them in the wide water, which he so much desired. The
whole description given by Thucydidês, of the sudden wheeling of
the Peloponnesian fleet, whereby Phormio’s ships were assailed, and
nine of them cut off, shows that the two fleets must have been very
close together when that movement was undertaken. If they had not
been close,—if the Peloponnesians had had to row any considerable
distance after wheeling,—all the Athenian ships might have escaped
along shore without any difficulty. In fact, the words of Thucydidês
imply that <i>both</i> the two fleets, at the time when the wheel of
the Peloponnesians was made, <i>were sailing in parallel directions
along the northern coast in the direction of Naupaktus</i>,—ὅπως
εἰ ἄρα νομίσας ἐπὶ τὴν Ναύπακτον αὐτοὺς πλεῖν ὁ Φορμίων <em
class="gesperrt">καὶ αὐτὸς ἐπιβοηθῶν</em> ταύτῃ παραπλέοι,—“if he
<i>also</i>, with a view to defend the place, should sail along that
coast,” (that is, if he, <i>as well as they</i>:) which seems to be the
distinct meaning of the particle καὶ in this place.</p>

<p>Now if we suppose the Peloponnesian fleet to have sailed from
its original station towards Naupaktus, all the events which follow
become thoroughly perspicuous and coherent. I apprehend that no one
would ever have entertained any other idea, except from the words
of Thucydidês,—ἔπλεον ἐπὶ τὴν <em class="gesperrt">ἑαυτῶν</em>
γῆν ἔσω ἐπὶ τοῦ κόλπου. Since the subject or nominative case of
the verb ἔπλεον is οἱ Πελοποννήσιοι, it has been supposed that
the word <em class="gesperrt">ἑαυτῶν</em> must necessarily refer
to the Peloponnesians; and Mr. Bloomfield, with whom I agree
as to the signification of the passage, proposes to alter <em
class="gesperrt">ἑαυτῶν</em> into <em class="gesperrt">αὐτῶν</em>. It
appears to me that this alteration is not necessary, and that ἑαυτῶν
may very well be construed so as to refer to the <i>Athenians</i>, not
to the Lacedæmonians. The reflective meaning of the pronoun ἑαυτῶν
is <i>not necessarily</i> thrown back upon the subject of the action
<i>immediately</i> preceding it, in a complicated sentence where there is
more than one subject and more than one action. Thus, for instance,
in this very passage of Thucydidês which I have transcribed, we find
the word ἑαυτῶν a second time used, and used so that its meaning is
thrown back, not upon the subject immediately preceding, but upon a
subject more distant from it,—ἐπὶ δ᾽ αὐτῷ (τῷ κέρατι) εἴκοσι ναῦς
ἔταξαν τὰς ἄριστα πλεούσας, ὅπως, εἰ ἄρα..., μὴ διαφύγοιεν πλέοντα
τὸν ἐπίπλουν σφῶν οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι <em class="gesperrt">ἔξω τοῦ ἑαυτῶν
κέρως</em>, ἀλλ᾽ αὗται αἱ νῆες περικλῄσειαν. Now here the words
τοῦ ἑαυτῶν κέρως, allude to the Peloponnesian fleet, not to the
Athenians, which latter is the subject immediately preceding. Poppo
and Göller both admit such to be the true meaning; and if this be
admissible, there appears to me no greater difficulty in construing
the words ἐπὶ τὴν ἑαυτῶν γῆν to mean, “the land of the <i>Athenians</i>,”
<i>not</i> “the land of the <i>Peloponnesians</i>.” Ἑαυτῶν might have been
more unambiguously expressed by ἐκείνων αὑτῶν; for the reflective
signification embodied in αὑτῶν is here an important addition to the
meaning: “Since the Athenians did not sail into the interior of the
gulf and the narrow waters, the Peloponnesians, wishing to bring them
in even reluctantly, sailed <i>against the Athenians’ own land</i> in the
interior.”</p>

<p>Another passage may be produced from Thucydidês, in which
the two words ἑαυτοῦ and ἐκείνου are both used in the same
sentence and designate the same person, ii, 13. Περικλῆς,
ὑποτοπήσας, ὅτι Ἀρχίδαμος αὐτῷ ξένος ὢν ἐτύγχανε, μὴ πολλάκις
ἢ αὐτὸς ἰδίᾳ βουλόμενος χαρίζεσθαι τοὺς ἀγροὺς αὐτοῦ παραλίπῃ
καὶ μὴ δῃώσῃ, ἢ καὶ Λακεδαιμονίων κελευσάντων ἐπὶ διαβολῇ τῇ
<em class="gesperrt">ἑαυτοῦ</em> γένηται τοῦτο, ὥσπερ καὶ τὰ
ἄγη ἐλαύνειν προεῖπον ἕνεκα <em class="gesperrt">ἐκείνου</em>·
προηγόρευε τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις ἐν τῇ ἐκκλησίᾳ ὅτι Ἀρχίδαμος μὲν οἱ ξένος
εἴη, οὐ μέντοι ἐπὶ κακῷ γε τῆς πόλεως γένοιτο, τοὺς δ᾽ ἀγροὺς <em
class="gesperrt">τοὺς ἑαυτοῦ</em> καὶ οἰκίας ἢν ἄρα μὴ δῃώσωσιν οἱ
πολέμιοι ὥσπερ καὶ τὰ τῶν ἄλλων, ἀφίησιν αὐτὰ δημόσια εἶναι. Here
ἑαυτοῦ and ἐκείνου (compare an analogous passage, Xenophon, Hellen.
i, 1, 27) both refer to Periklês; and ἑαυτοῦ is twice used, so that
it reflects back not upon the subject of the action immediately
preceding it, but upon another subject farther behind. Again, iv, 99.
Οἱ δὲ Βοιωτοὶ ἀπεκρίναντο, εἰ μὲν ἐν τῇ Βοιωτίᾳ εἰσίν (οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι),
ἀπιόντας <em class="gesperrt">ἐκ τῆς ἑαυτῶν</em> ἀποφέρεσθαι τὰ
σφέτερα· εἰ δ᾽ ἐν τῇ <em class="gesperrt">ἐκείνων</em>, αὐτοὺς
γιγνώσκειν τὸ ποιητέον. Here the use of ἑαυτῶν and ἐκείνων is
remarkable. Ἑαυτῶν refers to the Bœotians, though the Athenians
are the subject of the action immediately preceding; while ἐκείνων
refers to the Athenians, in another case where they are the subject
of the action immediately preceding. We should almost have expected
to find the position of the two words reversed. Again, in iv, 57,
we have—Καὶ τούτους μὲν οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ἐβουλεύσαντο καταθέσθαι ἐς τὰς
νήσους, καὶ τοὺς ἄλλους Κυθηρίους <em class="gesperrt">οἰκοῦντας τὴν
ἑαυτῶν</em> φόρον τέσσαρα τάλαντα φέρειν. Here ἑαυτῶν refers to the
subject of the action immediately preceding—that is, to Κυθηρίους,
not to Ἀθηναῖοι: but when we turn to another chapter, iii, 78: οἱ δὲ
Ἀθηναῖοι φοβούμενοι τὸ πλῆθος καὶ τὴν περικύκλωσιν, ἁθρόαις μέν οὐ
προσέπιπτον οὐδὲ κατὰ μέσον <em class="gesperrt">ταῖς ἐφ᾽ ἑαυτοὺς
τεταγμέναις</em> (ναυσὶ)—we find ἑαυτῶν thrown back upon the subject,
<i>not</i> immediately preceding it. The same, iv, 47—εἴ πού τίς τινα
ἴδοι ἐχθρὸν ἑαυτοῦ; and ii, 95. Ὁ γὰρ Περδίκκας αὐτῷ ὑποσχόμενος, εἰ
Ἀθηναίοις τε διαλλάξειεν <em class="gesperrt">ἑαυτὸν</em> (<i>i. e.</i>
Perdikkas), κατ᾽ ἀρχὰς τῷ πολέμῳ πιεζόμενον, etc.</p>

<p>Compare also Homer, Odyss. xvii, 387. Πτωχὸν δ᾽ οὐκ ἄν τις καλέοι,
τρύξοντα ἓ αὐτόν; and Xenophon, Memorab. iv, 2, 28; i, 6, 3; v, 2,
24; Anabas. vii. 2, 10; 6, 43; Hellen. v, 2, 39.</p>

<p>It appears to me, that when we study the use of the pronoun
ἑαυτὸς, we shall see reason to be convinced that in the passage of
Thucydidês now before us, the phrase οἱ Πελοποννήσιοι ἔπλεον ἐς τὴν
ἑαυτῶν γῆν, need not necessarily be referred to the <i>Peloponnesian</i>
land, but may in perfect conformity with analogy be understood to
mean the <i>Athenian</i> land. I am sure that, in so construing it, we
shall not put so much violence upon the meaning as the Scholiast and
Dr. Arnold have put upon the preposition ἐπὶ, when the Scholiast
states that ἐπὶ τὴν ἑαυτῶν γῆν means the same thing as παρὰ τὴν
ἑαυτῶν γῆν, and when Dr. Arnold admits this opinion, only adding a
new meaning which does not usually belong to ἐπὶ with an accusative
case.</p>

<p>An objection to the meaning which I propose may possibly
be grounded on the word νομίσας, applied to Phormio. If the
Peloponnesian fleet was sailing directly towards Naupaktus, it may
be urged, Phormio would not be said to <i>think</i> that they were going
thither, but <i>to see</i> or <i>become aware</i> of it. But in reply to this
we may observe, that the Peloponnesians never really intended to
attack Naupaktus, though they directed their course towards it;
they wished in reality to draw Phormio within the strait, and there
to attack him. The historian, therefore, says with propriety, that
Phormio would <i>believe</i>, and not that he would <i>perceive</i>, them to be
going thither, since his belief would really be erroneous.</p>

sufficiently evident that the Athenians defeated and drove off
not only the twenty Peloponnesian ships of the right or pursuing
wing,—but also the left and centre. Otherwise, they would not have
been able to recapture those Athenian ships which had been lost at
the beginning of the battle. Thucydidês, indeed, does not expressly
mention the Peloponnesian left and centre as following the right
in their pursuit towards Naupaktus. But we may presume that they
partially did so, probably careless of much order, as being at first
under the impression that the victory was gained. They were probably,
therefore, thrown into confusion without much difficulty, when the
twenty ships of the right were beaten and driven back upon them,—even
though the victorious Athenian triremes were no more than eleven in
number.</p>

Bishop’s published in the Appendix to Dr. Arnold’s Thucydidês, vol.
i. His remarks upon ὑπηρέσιον are more satisfactory than those upon
τροπωτήρ. Whether the fulcrum of the oar was formed by a thowell,
or a notch, on the gunwale, or by a perforation in the ship’s side,
there must in both cases have been required—since it seems to have
had nothing like what Dr. Bishop calls a <i>nut</i>—a thong to prevent
it from slipping down towards the water; especially with the oars
of the thranitæ, or upper tier of rowers, who pulled at so great an
elevation, comparatively speaking, above the water. Dr. Arnold’s
explanation of τροπωτὴρ is suited to the case of a boat, but not
to that of a trireme. Dr. Bishop shows that the explanation of the
purpose of the ὑπηρέσιον, given by the Scholiast, is not the true
one.</p>

<p>This universal necessity of presents and bribes may be seen
illustrated in the dealings of Xenophon and the Cyreian army with the
Thracian prince Seuthes, described in the Anabasis, vii, chapters 1
and 2. It appears that even at that time, <small>B.C.</small> 401,
the Odrysian dominion, though it had passed through disturbances
and had been practically enfeebled, still extended down to the
neighborhood of Byzantium. In commenting upon the venality of the
Thracians, the Scholiast has a curious comparison with his own
time—καὶ οὐκ ἦν τι πρᾶξαι παρ᾽ αὐτοῖς τὸν μὴ διδόντα χρήματα· <em
class="gesperrt">ὅπερ καὶ νῦν ἐν Ῥωμαίοις</em>. The Scholiast
here tells us that the venality in his time as to public affairs,
in the Roman empire, was not less universal: of what century of
the Roman empire he speaks, we do not know: perhaps about 500-600
<small>A.D.</small></p>

<p>The contrast which Thucydidês here draws between the Thracians and
the Persians is also illustrated by what Xenophon says respecting the
habits of the younger Cyrus: (Anabas. i, 9, 22): compare also the
romance of the Cyropædia, viii, 14, 31, 32.</p>

The fact respecting Doxander here mentioned is stated by Aristotle,

the commonwealth. He represents Doxander and his private quarrel as
having brought upon Mitylênê the resentment of the Athenians and
the war with Athens—Δόξανδρος—ἦρξε τῆς στάσεως, καὶ παρώξυνε τοὺς
Ἀθηναίους, πρόξενος ὢν τῆς πόλεως.</p>

<p>Having the account of Thucydidês before us, we are enabled to say
that this is an incorrect conception, as far as concerns the <i>cause</i>
of the war,—though the fact in itself may be quite true.</p>

<p>I have endeavored to render as well as I can this obscure and
difficult passage; difficult both as to grammar and as to sense,
and not satisfactorily explained by any of the commentators,—if,
indeed, it can be held to stand now as Thucydidês wrote it. In the
preceding chapter, he had mentioned that this fleet of one hundred
sail was manned largely from the hoplite class of citizens (iii,
16). Now we know from other passages in his work (see v, 8; vi, 31)
how much difference there was in the appearance and efficiency of
an armament, according to the class of citizens who served on it.
We may then refer the word κάλλος to the excellence of outfit hence
arising: I wish, indeed, that any instance could be produced of
κάλλος in this sense, but we find the adjective κάλλιστος (Thucyd.
v, 60) στρατόπεδον γὰρ δὴ τοῦτο <em class="gesperrt">κάλλιστον</em>
Ἑλληνικὸν τῶν μέχρι τοῦδε ξυνῆλθεν. In v, 8, Thucydidês employs the
word ἀξίωμα to denote the same meaning; and in vi, 31, he says:
παρασκευὴ γὰρ αὑτὴ πρώτη ἐκπλεύσασα μιᾶς πόλεως δυνάμει Ἑλληνικῇ
πολυτελεστάτη δὴ καὶ εὐπρεπεστάτη τῶν εἰς ἐκεῖνον τὸν χρόνον ἐγένετο.
It may be remarked that in that chapter too, he contrasts the
expedition against Sicily with two other Athenian expeditions, equal
to it in number, but inferior in equipment: the same comparison which
I believe he means to take in this passage.</p>

his note, construes this passage as if the right or bare foot were
the <i>least</i> likely to slip in the mud, and the left or shod foot the
<i>most</i> likely. The Scholiast and Wasse maintain the opposite opinion,
which is certainly the more obvious sense of the text, though the
sense of Dr. Arnold would also be admissible. The naked foot is
very liable to slip in the mud, and might easily be rendered less
liable, by sandals, or covering particularly adapted to that purpose.
Besides, Wasse remarks justly, that the warrior who is to use his

that the blockaders must have been often in the habit of transmitting
intelligence to Thebes by means of fire-signals; each particular
combination of lights having more or less of a special meaning. The
Platæans had observed this, and foresaw that the same means would be
used on the night of the outbreak, to bring assistance from Thebes
forthwith. If they had not observed it <i>before</i>, they could not have
prepared for the moment when the new signal would be hoisted, so as
to confound its meaning—ὅπως ἀσαφῆ τὰ σημεῖα ᾖ....</p>

<p>Compare iii, 80. I agree with the general opinion stated in Dr.
Arnold’s note respecting these fire-signals, and even think that it
might have been sustained more strongly.</p>

<p>Dr. Arnold distinguishes οἶκτος (or ἔλεος) from ἐπιεικεία, by
saying that “the former is a feeling, the latter a habit: οἶκτος,
pity or compassion, may occasionally touch those who are generally
very far from being ἐπιεικεῖς—mild or gentle. Ἐπιεικεία relates to
all persons,—οἶκτος, to particular individuals.” The distinction
here taken is certainly in itself just, and ἐπιεικὴς sometimes has
the meaning ascribed to it by Dr. Arnold: but in this passage I
believe it has a different meaning. The contrast between οἶκτος and
ἐπιεικεία—as Dr. Arnold explains them—would be too feeble, and too
little marked, to serve the purpose of Kleon and Diodotus. Ἐπιεικεία
here rather means the disposition to stop short of your full rights;
a spirit of fairness and adjustment; an abatement on your part likely
to be requited by abatement on the part of your adversary: compare
Thucyd. i, 76; iv, 19; v, 86; viii, 93.</p>

<p>So Mr. Burke, in his speech on Conciliation with America (Burke’s
Works, vol. iii. pp. 69-74), in discussing the proposition of
prosecuting the acts of the refractory colonies as criminal: “The
thing seems a great deal too big for my ideas of jurisprudence. It
should seem, to my way of conceiving such matters, that there is a
wide difference in reason and policy, between the mode of proceeding
on the irregular conduct of scattered individuals, or even of bands
of men who disturb order within the state,—and the civil dissensions
which may from time to time agitate the several communities which
compose a great empire. It looks to me to be narrow and pedantic, to
apply the ordinary ideas of criminal justice to this great public
contest. I do not know the method of drawing up an indictment against
a whole people,” etc.—“My consideration is narrow, confined, and
wholly limited to the policy of the question.”</p>

with the views of punishment implied by Xenophon in his Anabasis,
where he is describing the government of Cyrus the younger:—</p>

<p>“Nor can any man contend, that Cyrus suffered criminals and
wrong-doers to laugh at him: he punished them with the most
unmeasured severity (ἀφειδέστατα πάντων ἐτιμωρεῖτο). And you might
often see along the frequented roads men deprived of their eyes,
their hands, and their feet: so that in his government either Greek
or barbarian, if he had no criminal purpose, might go fearlessly
through and carry whatever he found convenient.” (Anabasis, i, 9,
13.)</p>

<p>The severity of the punishment is, in Xenophon’s mind, the measure
both of its effects in deterring criminals, and of the character of
the ruler inflicting it.</p>

About the Lesbian kleruchs, see Boeckh, Public Econ. of Athens, B.
iii, c. 18; Wachsmuth, Hell. Alt. i. 2, p. 36. These kleruchs must
originally have gone thither as a garrison, as M. Boeckh remarks; and
may probably have come back, either all or a part, when needed for
military service at home, and when it was ascertained that the island
might be kept without them. Still, however, there is much which is
puzzling in this arrangement. It seems remarkable that the Athenians,
at a time when their accumulated treasure had been exhausted, and
when they were beginning to pay direct contributions from their
private property, should sacrifice five thousand four hundred minæ
(ninety talents) annual revenue capable of being appropriated by the
state, unless that sum were required to maintain the kleruchs as
resident garrison for the maintenance of Lesbos. And as it turned
out afterwards that their residence was not necessary, we may doubt
whether the state did not convert the kleruchic grants into a public
tribute, wholly or partially.</p>

<p>We may farther remark, that if the kleruch be supposed a citizen
resident at Athens, but receiving rent from his lot of land in some
other territory,—the analogy between him and the Roman colonist
fails. The Roman colonists, though retaining their privileges as
citizens, were sent out to reside on their grants of land, and to
constitute a sort of resident garrison over the prior inhabitants,
who had been despoiled of a portion of territory to make room for
them.</p>

<p>See, on this subject and analogy, the excellent Dissertation
of Madwig: De jure et conditione coloniarum Populi Romani quæstio
historica,—Madwig, Opuscul. Copenhag. 1834. Diss. viii, p. 246.</p>

<p>M. Boeckh and Dr. Arnold contend justly that at the time of the
expedition of Athens against Syracuse and afterwards (Thucyd. vii,
57; viii, 23), there could have been but few, if any, Athenian
kleruchs resident in Lesbos. We might even push this argument
farther, and apply the same inference to an earlier period, the
eighth year of the war (Thucyd. iv, 75), when the Mitylenæan exiles
were so active in their aggressions upon Antandrus and the other
towns, originally Mitylenæan possessions, on the opposite mainland.
There was no force near at hand on the part of Athens to deal with
these exiles except the ἀργυρόλογαι νῆες,—had there been kleruchs at
Mitylênê, they would probably have been able to defeat the exiles in
their first attempts, and would certainly have been among the most
important forces to put them down afterwards,—whereas Thucydidês
makes no allusion to them.</p>

<p>Farther, the oration of Antipho (De Cæde Herod. c. 13) makes no
allusion to Athenian kleruchs, either as resident in the island, or
even as absentees receiving the annual rent mentioned by Thucydidês.
The Mitylenæan citizen, father of the speaker of that oration, had
been one of those implicated—as he says, unwillingly—in the past
revolt of the city against Athens: since the deplorable termination
of that revolt he had continued possessor of his Lesbian property,
and continued also to discharge his obligations as well (choregic
obligations—χορηγίας) towards Mitylênê as (his obligations of
pecuniary payment—τέλη) towards Athens. If the arrangement mentioned
by Thucydidês had been persisted in, this Mitylenæan proprietor
would have paid nothing towards the city of Athens, but merely a
rent of two minæ to some Athenian kleruch, or citizen; which can
hardly be reconciled with the words of the speaker as we find them in
Antipho.</p>

<p class="mt1">Plutarch (Nikias, 6: compare Plutarch, Aristeidês,
c. 26) states the fact of Pachês having slain himself before the
dikastery on occasion of his trial of accountability. Πάχητα τὸν
ἕλοντα Λέσβον, ὃς, εὐθύνας δίδους τῆς στρατηγίας, ἐν αὐτῷ τῷ
δικαστηρίῳ σπασάμενος ξίφος ἀνεῖλεν ἑαυτὸν, etc.</p>

<p>The statement in Plutarch, and that in the Epigram, hang together
so perfectly well, that each lends authority to the other, and I
think there is good reason for crediting the Epigram. The suicide
of Pachês, and that too before the dikasts, implies circumstances
very different from those usually brought in accusation against a
general on trial: it implies an intensity of anger in the numerous
dikasts greater than that which acts of peculation would be likely
to raise, and such as to strike a guilty man with insupportable
remorse and humiliation. The story of Lamaxis and Hellânis would be
just of a nature to produce this vehement emotion among the Athenian
dikasts. Moreover, the words of the Epigram,—μέσφα μιν εἰς ὀλοὴν
κῆρα συνηλασάτην,—are precisely applicable to a self-inflicted
death. It would seem by the Epigram, moreover, that, even in the
time of Agathias (<small>A.D.</small> 550—the reign of
Justinian), there must have been preserved at Mitylênê a sepulchral
monument commemorating this incident.</p>

<p>Schneider (ad Aristotel. Politic. v, 3, 2) erroneously identifies
this story with that of Doxander and the two ἐπίκληροι whom he wished
to obtain in marriage for his two sons.</p>

<p>Mr. Mitford doubts whether these two orations are to be taken as
approximating to anything really delivered on the occasion. But it
seems to me that the means possessed by Thucydidês for informing
himself of what was actually said at this scene before the captured
Platæa must have been considerable and satisfactory: I therefore
place full confidence in them, as I do in most of the other harangues
in his work, so far as <i>the substance</i> goes.</p>

concluded with the Thebans: and on this point, therefore, the
Thebans had really ground to complain. Respecting this convention,
however, there were two conflicting stories, between which Thucydidês

Pseudo-Demosthenês—in the oration against Neæra (p. 1380, c. 25),
says that the blockade of Platæa was continued for ten years before
it surrendered,—ἐπολιόρκουν αὐτοὺς διπλῷ τείχει περιτειχίσαντες δέκα
ἔτη. That the real duration of the blockade was only <i>two</i> years, is
most certain: accordingly, several eminent critics—Palmerius, Wasse,
Duker, Taylor, Auger, etc., all with one accord confidently enjoin
us to correct the text of Demosthenês from δέκα to δύο. “Repone
<i>fidenter</i> δύο,” says Duker.</p>

<p>I have before protested against corrections of the text of ancient
authors grounded upon the reason which all these critics think so
obvious and so convincing; and I must again renew the protest here.
It shows how little the principles of historical evidence have been
reflected upon, when critics can thus concur in forcing dissentient
witnesses into harmony, and in substituting a true statement of their
own in place of an erroneous statement which one of these witnesses
gives them. And in the present instance, the principle adopted by
these critics is the less defensible, because the Pseudo-Demosthenês
introduces a great many other errors and inaccuracies respecting
Platæa, besides his mistake about the duration of the siege. The ten
years’ siege of Troy was constantly present to the imaginations of
these literary Greeks.</p>

consecrated and protected by law, so that the proprietors of the
ground on which they stood were forbidden to grub them up, or to dig
so near as to injure the roots. The speaker in that oration defends
himself against a charge of having grubbed up one of these and sold

conduct of Nikostratus, as well as that of Phormio, in the naval
battles of the preceding summer, we contract a personal interest
respecting both of them. Thucydidês does not seem to have anticipated
that his account would raise such a feeling in the minds of his
readers, otherwise he probably would have mentioned something to
gratify it. Respecting Phormio, his omission is the more remarkable;
since we are left to infer, from the request made by the Akarnanians
to have his son sent as commander, that he must have died or become
disabled: yet the historian does not distinctly say so (iii, 7).</p>

<p>The Scholiast on Aristophanês (Pac. 347) has a story that Phormio
was asked for by the Akarnanians, but that he could not serve in
consequence of being at that moment under sentence for a heavy fine,
which he was unable to pay: accordingly, the Athenians contrived
a means of evading the fine, in order that he might be enabled to
serve. It is difficult to see how this can be reconciled with the
story of Thucydidês, who says that the son of Phormio went instead of
his father.</p>

<p>Compare Meineke, Histor. Critic. Comicc. Græc. vol. i, p. 144,
and Fragment. Eupolid. vol. ii, p. 527. Phormio was introduced as
a chief character in the Ταξίαρχοι of Eupolis; as a brave, rough,
straightforward soldier something like Lamachus in the Acharneis of
Aristophanês.</p>

μὲν καὶ ἀεὶ ἐσόμενα ἕως ἂν ἡ αὐτὴ φύσις ἀνθρώπων ᾖ, μᾶλλον δὲ καὶ
ἡσυχαίτερα καὶ τοῖς εἴδεσι διηλλαγμένα, ὡς ἂν ἕκασται αἱ μεταβολαὶ
τῶν ξυντυχιῶν ἐφιστῶνται, etc.</p>

<p>The many obscurities and perplexities of construction which
pervade these memorable chapters, are familiar to all readers of
Thucydidês, ever since Dionysius of Halikarnassus, whose remarks
upon them are sufficiently severe (Judic. de Thucyd. p. 883). To
discuss difficulties which the best commentators are sometimes unable
satisfactorily to explain, is no part of the business of this work:
yet there is one sentence which I venture to notice as erroneously
construed by most of them, following the Scholiast.</p>

<p>Τὸ δ᾽ ἐμπλήκτως ὀξὺ ἀνδρὸς μοίρᾳ προσετέθη, ἀσφάλεια δὲ (Dr.
Arnold and others read ἀσφαλείᾳ in the dative) τὸ ἐπιβουλεύσασθαι,
ἀποτροπῆς πρόφασις εὔλογος.</p>

<p>The Scholiast explains the latter half of this as follows: τὸ
ἐπιπολὺ βουλεύσασθαι δι᾽ ἀσφάλειαν πρόφασις ἀποτροπῆς ἐνομίζετο,,—and
this explanation is partly adopted by Poppo, Göller, and Dr. Arnold,
with differences about ἀσφάλεια and ἐπιβουλεύσασθαι, but all agreeing
about the word ἀποτροπὴ so that the sentence is made to mean, in
the words of Dr. Arnold: “But safely to concert measures against an
enemy, was accounted but a decent pretence for <i>declining the contest
with him altogether</i>.”</p>

<p>Now the signification here assigned to ἀποτροπὴ is one which does
not belong to it. Ἀποτροπὴ, in Thucydidês as well as elsewhere,
does not mean “tergiversation, or declining the contest:” it has an
active sense, and means, “the deterring, preventing, or dissuading
another person from something which he might be disposed to do,—or
the warding off of some threatening danger or evil:” the remarkable
adjective ἀποτροπαῖος is derived from it, and προτροπὴ, in rhetoric,
is its contrary term. In Thucydidês it is used in this active sense
(iii, 45): compare also Plato, Legg. ix, c. 1, p. 853; Isokratês,
Areopagatic. Or. vii, p. 143, sect. 17; Æschinês cont. Ktesiphon. c.
68, p. 442: Æschyl. Pers. 217; nor do the commentators produce any
passage to sustain the passive sense which they assign to it in the
sentence here under discussion, whereby they would make it equivalent
to ἀναχωρεῖν—ἀναχώρησις—or ἐξαναχωρεῖν (Thucyd. iv, 28; v, 65), “a
backing out.”</p>

<p>Giving the meaning which they do to ἀποτροπὴ, the commentators
are farther unavoidably embarrassed how to construe ἀσφάλεια
δὲ τὸ ἐπιβουλεύσασθαι, as may be seen by the notes of Poppo,
Göller, and Dr. Arnold. The Scholiast and Göller give to the word
ἐπιβουλεύσασθαι the very unusual meaning of “repeated and careful
deliberation,” instead of its common meaning of “laying snares for
another, concerting secret measures of hostility:” and Poppo and
Dr. Arnold alter ἀσφάλεια into the dative case ἀσφαλείᾳ, which, if
it were understood to be governed by προσετέθη, might make a fair
construction,—but which they construe along with τὸ ἐπιβουλεύσασθαι,
though the position of the particle δὲ, upon that supposition,
appears to me singularly awkward.</p>

<p>The great difficulty of construing the sentence arises from
the erroneous meaning attached to the word ἀποτροπὴ. But when we
interpret that word “deterrence, or prevention,” according to the
examples which I have cited, the whole meaning of the sentence
will become clear and consistent. Of the two modes of hurting a
party-enemy—1. violent and open attack; 2. secret manœuvre and
conspiracy—Thucydidês remarks first, what was thought of the one;
next, what was thought of the other, in the perverted state of
morality which he is discussing.</p>

<p>Τὸ δ᾽ ἐμπλήκτως ὀξὺ ἀνδρὸς μοίρᾳ προσετέθη—ἀσφάλεια δὲ τὸ
ἐπιβουλεύσασθαι, ἀποτροπῆς πρόφασις εὔλογος.</p>

<p>“Sharp and reckless attack was counted among the necessities of
the manly character: secret conspiracy against an enemy was held to
be safe precaution,—a specious pretence of preventing him from doing
the like.”</p>

<p>According to this construction, τὸ ἐπιβουλεύσασθαι is the subject;
ἀσφάλεια belongs to the predicate and the concluding words, ἀποτροπῆς
πρόφασις εὔλογος, are an epexegesis, or explanatory comment, upon
ἀσφάλεια. Probably we ought to consider some such word as ἐνομίζετο
to be understood,—just as the Scholiast understands that word for his
view of the sentence.</p>

Peisander departed from Athens to Samos: on his return, he finds
that these hetæries have been very actively employed, and had made
great progress towards the subversion of the democracy: they had
assassinated the demagogue Androklês and various other political
enemies,—οἱ δὲ ἀμφὶ τὸν Πείσανδρον—ἦλθον ἐς τὰς Ἀθήνας,—καὶ

or soldiers serving on shipboard (marines), were more usually taken
from the thetes, or the poorest class of citizens, furnished by the
state with a panoply for the occasion,—not from the regular hoplites
on the muster-roll. Maritime soldiery is, therefore, usually spoken
of as something inferior: the present triremes of Demosthenês are
noticed in the light of an exception (ναυτικῆς καὶ φαύλου στρατιᾶς,
Thucyd. vi, 21).</p>

<p>So among the Romans, service in the legions was accounted higher
and more honorable than that of the classiarii milites (Tacit.
Histor. i, 87).</p>

<p>The Athenian epibatæ, though not forming a corps permanently
distinct, correspond in function to the English marines, who seem to
have been first distinguished permanently from other foot-soldiers
about the year 1684. “It having been found necessary on many
occasions to embark a number of soldiers on board our ships of
war, and mere landsmen being at first extremely unhealthy,—and at
first, until they had been accustomed to the sea, in a great measure
unserviceable,—it was at length judged expedient to appoint certain
regiments for that service, who were trained to the different modes
of sea-fighting, and also made useful in some of those manœuvres of a
ship where a great many hands were required. These, from the nature
of their duty, were distinguished by the appellation of <i>maritime
soldiers</i>, or marines.”—Grose’s Military Antiquities of the English
Army, vol. i, p. 186. (London, 1786.)</p>

any talk or thought of the invasion of Ætolia, simply in prosecution
of the standing antipathy which they bore to Naupaktus: but that they
had sent envoys immediately when they heard of the preparations for
invading Ætolia,—yet before the invasion actually took place. The
words διὰ τὴν τῶν Ἀθηναίων ἐπαγωγήν show that this is the meaning.</p>

<p>The word ἐπαγωγὴ is rightly construed by Haack, against the
Scholiast: “Because the Naupaktians were bringing in the Athenians to
invade Ætolia.”</p>

<p>We may remark that the expression κατὰ τὸν πόλεμον τόνδε, when
it occurs in the first, second, third, or first half of the fourth
Book of Thucydidês, seems to allude to the first ten years of the
Peloponnesian war, which ended with the peace of Nikias.</p>

<p>In a careful dissertation, by Franz Wolfgang Ullrich, analyzing
the structure of the history of Thucydidês, it is made to appear
that the first, second, and third Books, with the first half of the
fourth, were composed during the interval between the peace of Nikias
and the beginning of the last nine years of the war, called the
Dekeleian war; allowing for two passages in these early books which
must have been subsequently introduced.</p>

<p>The later books seem to have been taken up by Thucydidês as a
separate work, continuing the former, and a sort of separate preface
is given for them (v, 26), γέγραφε δὲ καὶ ταῦτα ὁ αὐτὸς Θουκυδίδης
Ἀθηναῖος ἑξῆς, etc. It is in this later portion that he first takes
up the view peculiar to him, of reckoning the whole twenty-seven
years as one continued war only nominally interrupted (Ullrich,
Beiträge zur Erklärung des Thukydidês, pp. 85, 125, 138, etc.
Hamburgh, 1846).</p>

καὶ Ἀγραίους καταφυγοῦσιν Ἀμπρακιώταις καὶ Πελοποννησίοις ἀναχώρησιν
ἐσπείσαντο ἐξ Οἰνιαδῶν, οἵπερ καὶ μετανέστησαν παρὰ Σαλυνθίον.</p>

<p>This is a very difficult passage. Hermann has conjectured, and
Poppo, Göller, and Dr. Arnold all approve, the reading παρὰ Σαλυνθίου
instead of the two last words of this sentence. The passage might
certainly be construed with this emendation, though there would
still be an awkwardness in the position of the relative οἵπερ with
regard to its antecedent, and in the position of the particle καὶ,
which ought then properly to come after μετανέστησαν, and not
before it. The sentence would then mean, that “the Ambrakiots and
Peloponnesians, who had originally taken refuge with Salynthius, had
moved away from his territory to Œniadæ,” from which place they were
now to enjoy safe departure.</p>

<p>I think, however, that the sentence would construe equally well,
or at least with no greater awkwardness, without any conjectural
alteration of the text, if we suppose Οἰνιαδῶν to be not merely the
name of the place, but the name of the inhabitants: and the word
seems to be used in this double sense (Thucyd. ii, 100). As the word
is already in the patronymic form, it would be difficult to deduce
from it a new <i>nomen gentile</i>. Several of the Attic demes, which
are in the patronymic form, present this same double meaning. If
this supposition be admitted, the sentence will mean, that “safe
retreat was granted to Ambrakiots and Peloponnesians from the
Œniade, who <i>also</i>—καὶ, that is, they as well as the Ambrakiots
and Peloponnesians—went up to the territory of Salynthius.” These
Œniadæ were enemies of the general body of Akarnanians (ii, 100), and
they may well have gone thither to help in extricating the fugitive
Ambrakiots and Peloponnesians.</p>

<p id="Footnote_505"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_505">[505]</a></span> Topography of Sphakteria
and Pylus. The description given by Thucydidês, of the memorable
incidents in or near Pylus and Sphakteria, is perfectly clear,
intelligible, and consistent with itself, as to topography. But
when we consult the topography of the scene as it stands now, we
find various circumstances which cannot possibly be reconciled with
Thucydidês. Both Colonel Leake (Travels in the Morea, vol. i, pp.
402-415) and Dr. Arnold (Appendix to the second and third volume of
his Thucydidês, p. 444) have given plans of the coast, accompanied
with valuable remarks.</p>

<p>The main discrepancy, between the statement of Thucydidês and
the present state of the coast, is to be found in the breadth of
the two channels between Sphakteria and the mainland. The southern
entrance into the bay of Navarino is now between thirteen hundred
and fourteen hundred yards, with a depth of water varying from five,
seven, twenty-eight, thirty-three fathoms; whereas Thucydidês states
it as being only a breadth adequate to admit eight or nine triremes
abreast. The northern entrance is about one hundred and fifty yards
in width, with a shoal or bar of sand lying across it on which there
are not more than eighteen inches of water: Thucydidês tells us that
it afforded room for no more than two triremes, and his narrative
implies a much greater depth of water, so as to make the entrance for
triremes perfectly unobstructed.</p>

<p>Colonel Leake supposes that Thucydidês was misinformed as to the
breadth of the southern passage; but Dr. Arnold has on this point
given a satisfactory reply,—that the narrowness of the breadth is
not merely affirmed in the numbers of Thucydidês, but is indirectly
implied in his narrative, where he tells us that the Lacedæmonians
intended to choke up both of them by triremes closely packed.
Obviously, this expedient could not be dreamt of, except for a very
narrow mouth. The same reply suffices against the doubts which
Bloomfield and Poppo (Comment. p. 10) raise about the genuineness
of the numerals ὀκτὼ or ἐννέα in Thucydidês; a doubt which merely
transfers the supposed error from Thucydidês to the writer of the
MS.</p>

<p id="doubt">Dr. Arnold has himself raised a still graver doubt;
whether the island now called Sphagia be really the same as Sphakteria,
and whether the bay of Navarino be the real harbor of Pylus. He
suspects that the Pale-Navarino which has been generally understood
to be Pylus, was in reality the ancient Sphakteria, separated from
the mainland in ancient times by a channel at the north as well as by
another at the southeast,—though now it is not an island at all. He
farther suspects that the lake or lagoon called Lake of Osmyn Aga,
north of the harbor of Navarino, and immediately under that which he
supposes to have been Sphakteria, was the ancient harbor of Pylus, in
which the sea-fight between the Athenians and Lacedæmonians took place.
He does not, indeed, assert this as a positive opinion, but leans to
it as the most probable, admitting that there are difficulties either
way.</p>

<p>Dr. Arnold has stated some of the difficulties which beset this
hypothesis (p. 447), but there was one which he has not stated, which
appears to me the most formidable of all, and quite fatal to the
admissibility of his opinion. If the Paleokastro of Navarino was the
real ancient Sphakteria, it must have been a second island situated
to the northward of Sphagia. There must therefore have been <i>two</i>
islands close together off the coast and near the scene. Now if the
reader will follow the account of Thucydidês, he will see that there
certainly was no more than <i>one</i> island,—Sphakteria, without any
other near or adjoining to it; see especially c. 13: the Athenian
fleet under Eurymedon, on first arriving, was obliged to go back some
distance to the island of Prôtê, because <i>the island</i> of Sphakteria
was full of Lacedæmonian hoplites: if Dr. Arnold’s hypothesis were
admitted, there would have been nothing to hinder them from landing
on Sphagia itself,—the same inference may be deduced from c. 8. The
statement of Pliny (H. N. iv, 12) that there were <i>tres Sphagiæ</i> off
Pylus, unless we suppose with Hardouin that two of them were mere
rocks, appears to me inconsistent with the account of Thucydidês.</p>

<p>I think that there is no alternative except to suppose that a
great alteration has taken place in the two passages which separate
Sphagia from the mainland, during the interval of two thousand four
hundred years which separates us from Thucydidês. The mainland to the
south of Navarino must have been much nearer than it is now to the
southern portion of Sphagia, while the northern passage also must
have been then both narrower and clearer. To suppose a change in the
configuration of the coast to this extent, seems noway extravagant:
any other hypothesis which may be started will be found involved in
much greater difficulty.</p>

<p>The expression, “the harbor which was not small,” to designate the
spacious bay of Navarino, has excited much remark from Mr. Bloomfield
and Dr. Arnold, and was indeed one of the reasons which induced the
latter to suspect that the harbor meant by Thucydidês was <i>not</i> the
bay of Navarino, but the neighboring lake of Osmyn Aga.</p>

<p>I have already discussed that supposition <a href="#doubt">in a
former note</a>: but in reference to the expression οὐ σμικρῷ, we
may observe, first, that the use of negative expressions to convey a
positive idea would be in the ordinary manner of Thucydidês.</p>

<p>But farther, I have stated in a previous note that it is
indispensable, in my judgment, to suppose the island of Sphakteria to
have touched the mainland much more closely in the time of Thucydidês
than it does now. At that time, therefore, very probably, the basin
of Navarino was not so large as we now find it.</p>

<p>I understand these words κοινὴ and ἰδία agreeably to the
explanation of the Scholiast, from whom Dr. Arnold, as well as Poppo
and Göller, depart, in my judgment erroneously. The whole war had
been begun in consequence of the complaints of the Peloponnesian
allies, and of wrongs alleged to have been done to <i>them</i> by Athens:
Sparta herself had no ground of complaint,—nothing of which she
desired redress.</p>

<p>Dr. Arnold translates it: “We shall hate you not only nationally,
for the wound you have inflicted on Sparta; but also individually,
because so many of us will have lost our near relations from your
inflexibility.” “The Spartan aristocracy (he adds) would feel it a
personal wound to lose at once so many of its members, connected by
blood or marriage with its principal families: compare Thucyd. v,
15.”</p>

<p>We must recollect, however, that the Athenians could not possibly
know at this time that the hoplites inclosed in Sphakteria belonged
in great proportion to the first families in Sparta. And the Spartan
envoys would surely have the diplomatic prudence to abstain from any
facts or arguments which would reveal, or even suggest, to them so
important a secret.</p>

Burke on the temper of England during the American war.</p>

<p>“You remember that in the beginning of this American war, you
were greatly divided: and a very strong body, if not the strongest,
opposed itself to the madness which every art and every power were
employed to render popular, in order that the errors of the rulers
might be lost in the general blindness of the nation. This opposition
continued until after our great, but most unfortunate, victory at
Long Island. Then all the mounds and banks of our constancy were
borne down at once; and the frenzy of the American war broke in upon
us like a deluge. This victory, which seemed to put an immediate end
to all difficulties, perfected in us that spirit of domination which
our unparalleled prosperity had but too long nurtured. We had been
so very powerful, and so very prosperous, that even the humblest of
us were degraded into the devices and follies of kings. We lost all
measure between means and ends; and our headlong desires became our
politics and our morals. All men who wished for peace, or retained
any sentiments of moderation, were overborne or silenced: and this
city (Bristol) was led by every artifice (and probably with the more
management, because <i>I</i> was one of your members) to distinguish
itself by its zeal for that fatal cause.” Burke, Speech to the
Electors of Bristol previous to the election (Works, vol. iii, p.
365).</p>

ἐνταῦθα χαλεπὸν τοῖς Λακεδαιμονίοις καθίστατο· οὔτε γὰρ οἱ πῖλοι
ἔστεγον τὰ τοξεύματα, δοράτιά τε ἐναποκέκλαστο βαλλομένων, εἶχον δὲ
οὐδὲν σφίσιν αὐτοῖς χρήσασθαι, ἀποκεκλῃμένοι μὲν τῇ ὄψει τοῦ προορᾷν,
ὑπὸ δὲ τῆς μείζονος βοῆς τῶν πολεμίων τὰ ἐν αὐτοῖς παραγγελλόμενα
οὐκ ἐσακούοντες, κινδύνου δὲ πανταχόθεν περιεστῶτος, καὶ οὐκ ἔχοντες
ἐλπίδα καθ᾽ ὅ,τι χρὴ ἀμυνομένους σωθῆναι.</p>

<p>There has been doubt and difficulty in this passage, even from
the time of the Scholiasts. Some commentators have translated πῖλοι
<i>caps</i> or <i>hats</i>,—others, <i>padded cuirasses</i> of wool or felt, round
the breast and back: see the notes of Duker, Dr. Arnold, Poppo,
and Göller. That the word πῖλος is sometimes used for the helmet,
or head-piece, is unquestionable,—sometimes even (with or without
χαλκοὺς) for a brazen helmet (see Aristophan. Lysis. 562; Antiphanês
ap. Athenæ. xi, p. 503); but I cannot think that on this occasion
Thucydidês would specially indicate the head of the Lacedæmonian
hoplite as his chief vulnerable part. Dr. Arnold, indeed, offers a
reason to prove that he might naturally do so; but in my judgment the
reason is very insufficient.</p>

<p>Πῖλοι means stuffed clothing of wool or felt, whether employed
to protect head, body, or feet: and I conceive, with Poppo and
others, that it here indicates the body-clothing of the Lacedæmonian
hoplite; his body being the part most open to be wounded on the side
undefended by the shield, as well as in the rear. That the word πῖλοι
will bear this sense may be seen in Pollux, vii, 171; Plato, Timæus,
p. 74; and Symposion, p. 220, c. 35: respecting πῖλος as applied to
the foot-covering,—Bekker, Chariklês, vol. ii, p. 376.</p>

<em class="gesperrt">καίπερ μανιώδης οὖσα ἡ ὑπόσχεσις ἀπέβη</em>·
ἐντὸς γὰρ εἴκοσιν ἡμερῶν ἤγαγε τοὺς ἄνδρας, ὥσπερ ὑπέστη.</p>

<p>Mr. Mitford, in recounting these incidents, after having said,
respecting Kleon: “In a <i>very extraordinary train of circumstances</i>
which followed, <i>his impudence and his fortune</i> (if, in the want of
another, we may use that term) wonderfully favored him,” goes on to
observe, two pages farther:—</p>

<p>“It however soon appeared, that though for a man like Cleon,
unversed in military command, the undertaking was rash and the
bragging promise abundantly ridiculous, yet the business was not so
desperate as it was in the moment generally imagined: and in fact
the folly of the Athenian people, in committing such a trust to
such a man, far exceeded that of the man himself, whose impudence
seldom carried him beyond the control of his cunning. He had received
intelligence that Demosthenês had already formed the plan and was
preparing for the attempt, with the forces upon the spot and in
the neighborhood. Hence, his apparent moderation in the demand for
troops; which he judiciously accommodated to the gratification
of the Athenian people, by avoiding to require any Athenians. He
farther showed his judgment, when the decree was to be passed
which was finally to direct the expedition, by a request which was
readily granted, that Demosthenês might be joined with him in the
command.” (Mitford, Hist. of Greece, vol. iii, ch. xv, sect. vii. pp.
250-253.)</p>

<p>It appears as if no historian could write down the name of
Kleon without attaching to it some disparaging verb or adjective.
We are here told in the same sentence that Kleon was an <i>impudent
braggart</i> for <i>promising the execution of the enterprise</i>,—and yet
that the enterprise itself was <i>perfectly feasible</i>. We are told in
one sentence that he was rash and ridiculous for promising this,
<i>unversed as he was in military command</i>: a few words farther, we
are informed that he expressly requested that the most competent man
to be found, Demosthenês, might be named his colleague. We are told
of the <i>cunning of Kleon</i>, and that <i>Kleon had received intelligence
from Demosthenês</i>,—as if this were some private communication to
himself. But Demosthenês had sent no news to Kleon, nor did Kleon
know anything which was not equally known to every man in the
assembly. <i>The folly of the people in committing the trust to Kleon</i>
is denounced,—as if Kleon had sought it himself, or as if his friends
had been the first to propose it for him. If the folly of the people
was thus great, what are we to say of the knavery of the oligarchical
party, with Nikias at their head, who impelled the people into
this folly, for the purpose of ruining a political antagonist, and
who forced Kleon into the post against his own most unaffected
reluctance? Against this manœuvre of the oligarchical party, neither
Mr. Mitford nor any other historian says a word. When Kleon judges
circumstances rightly, as Mr. Mitford allows that he did in this
case, he has credit for nothing better than <i>cunning</i>.</p>

<p>The truth is, that the people committed no folly in appointing
Kleon, for he justified the best expectations of his friends. But
Nikias and his friends committed great knavery in proposing it,
since they fully believed that he would fail. And, even upon Mr.
Mitford’s statement of the case, the opinion of Thucydidês which
stands at the beginning of this note is thoroughly unjustifiable; not
less unjustifiable than the language of the modern historian about
the “extraordinary circumstances,” and the way in which Kleon was
“favored by fortune.” Not a single incident can be specified in the
narrative to bear out these invidious assertions.</p>

<p id="Footnote_561"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_561">[561]</a></span> The jest of an unknown comic
writer (probably Eupolis or Aristophanês, in one of the many lost
dramas) against Kleon: “that he showed great powers of prophecy
after the fact,” (Κλέων Προμηθεύς ἐστι μετὰ τὰ πράγματα, Lucian,
Prometheus, c. 2), may probably have reference to his proceedings
about Sphakteria: if so, it is certainly undeserved.</p>

<p>In the letter which he sent to announce the capture of Sphakteria
and the prisoners to the Athenians, it is affirmed that he began
with the words—Κλέων Ἀθηναίων τῇ Βουλῇ καὶ τῷ Δήμῳ χαίρειν. This was
derided by Eupolis, and is even considered as a piece of insolence,
though it is difficult to see why (Schol. ad Aristophan. Plut. 322;

arise to Sparta from the occupation of Kythêra by an enemy, furnishes
one additional probability tending to show that his history was
composed before the actual occupation of the island by Nikias, in the
eighth year of the Peloponnesian war. Had he been cognizant of this
latter event, he would naturally have made some allusion to it.</p>

<p>The words of Thucydidês in respect to the island of Kythêra
are, the Lacedæmonians πολλὴν ἐπιμέλειαν ἐποιοῦντο· ἦν γὰρ αὐτοῖς
τῶν τε ἀπ᾽ Αἰγύπτου καὶ Λιβύης ὁλκάδων προσβολὴ, καὶ λῃσταὶ ἅμα

<p>I do not understand this passage, with Dr. Arnold and Göller, to
mean, that Laconia was unassailable by land, but very assailable by
sea. It rather means that the only portion of the coast of Laconia
where a maritime invader could do much damage, was in the interior
of the Laconic gulf, near Helos, Gythium, etc., which is in fact
the only plain portion of the coast of Laconia. The two projecting
promontories, which end, the one in Cape Malea, the other in Cape
Tænarus, are high, rocky, harborless, and afford very little
temptation to a disembarking enemy. “The whole Laconian coast is
<i>high projecting cliff</i>, where it fronts the Sicilian and Kretan
seas,”—<em class="gesperrt">πᾶσα ἀνέχει</em>. The island of Kythêra
was particularly favorable for facilitating descents on the territory
near Helos and Gythium. The ἀλιμενότης of Laconia is noticed in
Xenophon, Hellen. iv, 8, 7, where he describes the occupation of the
island by Konon and Pharnabazus.</p>

<p>See Colonel Leake’s description of this coast, and the high cliffs
between Cape Matapan—Tænarus—and Kalamata, which front the Sicilian
sea, as well as those eastward of Cape St. Angelo, or Malea, which
front the Kretan sea (Travels in Morea, vol. i, ch. vii, p. 261:
“tempestuous, rocky, unsheltered coast of Mesamani,” ch. viii, p.

<p>Dr. Thirlwall (History of Greece, vol. iii. ch. xxiii, p. 244,
2d edit. <i>note</i>) thinks that this assassination of Helots by the
Spartans took place at some other time unascertained, and not at the
time here indicated. I cannot concur in this opinion. It appears
to me, that there is the strongest probable reason for referring
the incident to the time immediately following the disaster in
Sphakteria, which Thucydidês so especially marks (iv, 41) by the
emphatic words: Οἱ δὲ Λακεδαιμόνιοι ἀμαθεῖς ὄντες ἐν τῷ πρὶν χρόνῳ
λῃστείας καὶ τοῦ τοιούτου πολέμου, τῶν τε Εἱλώτων αὐτομολούντων
καὶ φοβούμενοι μὴ καὶ ἐπὶ μακρότερον σφίσι τι νεωτερισθῇ τῶν κατὰ
τὴν χώραν, οὐ ῥᾳδίως ἔφερον. This was just after the Messenians
were first established at Pylus, and began their incursions over
Laconia, with such temptations as they could offer to the Helots to
desert. And it was naturally just then that the fear, entertained
by the Spartans of their Helots, became exaggerated to the maximum,
leading to the perpetration of the act mentioned in the text. Dr.
Thirlwall observes, “that the Spartan government would not order
the massacre of the Helots at a time when it could employ them on
foreign service.” But to this it may be replied, that the capture of
Sphakteria took place in July or August, while the expedition under
Brasidas was not organized until the following winter or spring.
There was therefore an interval of some months during which the
government had not yet formed the idea of employing the Helots on
foreign service. And this interval is quite sufficient to give a full
and distinct meaning to the expression καὶ τότε (Thucyd. iv, 80) on
which Dr. Thirlwall insists; without the necessity of going back to
any more remote point of antecedent time.</p>

<p>I cannot think, with Poppo and Göller, that the participle

<small>PULLED DOWN</small> the portion of the Long Walls near Megara.
This may have been done, but it would be an operation of no great
importance; for to pull down a portion of the wall would not bar
the access from the city, which it was the object of the Athenians
to accomplish. “They broke off” the communication along the road
between the Long Walls from the city to Nisæa, by building across
or barricading the space between: similar to what is said a little

Bœotian confederacy: compare the various conjectures in Boeckh, ad

<p>Here Dr. Arnold observes: “This confirms and illustrates what has
been said in the note on ii, 2, 5, as to the practice of the Greek
soldiers piling their arms the moment they halted in a particular
part of the camp, and always attending the speeches of their general
without them.”</p>

<p>In the case here before us, it appears that the Bœotians did
come by separate lochi, pursuant to command, to hear the words of
Pagondas, and also that each lochus left its arms to do so; though
even here it is not absolutely certain that τὰ ὅπλα does not mean
<i>the military station</i>, as Dukas interprets it. But Dr. Arnold
generalizes too hastily from hence to a customary practice as between
soldiers and their general. The proceeding of the Athenian general
Hippokratês, on this very occasion, near Delium, to be noticed a page
or two forward, exhibits an arrangement totally different. Moreover,
the note on ii, 2, 5, to which Dr. Arnold refers, has no sort of
analogy to the passage here before us, which does not include the
words τίθεσθαι τὰ ὅπλα; whereas these words are the main matters in
chapter ii, 2, 5. Whoever attentively compares the two, will see
that Dr. Arnold, followed by Poppo and Göller, has stretched an
explanation which suits the passage here before us to other passages
where it is no way applicable.</p>

etc.</p>

<p>I transcribe this passage for the purpose of showing how
impossible it is to admit the explanation which Dr. Arnold, Poppo,
and Göller give of these words ἔθεντο τὰ ὅπλα (see Notes ad Thucyd.
ii, 2). They explain the words to mean, that the soldiers “piled
their arms into a heap,” disarmed themselves for the time. But the
Bœotians, in the situation here described, cannot possibly have
parted with their arms, they were just on the point of charging the
enemy: immediately afterwards, Pagondas gives the word, the pæan for
charging is sung, and the rush commences. Pagondas had, doubtless,
good reason for directing a momentary halt, to see that his ranks
were in perfectly good condition before the charge began. But to
command his troops to “pile their arms” would be the last thing that
he would think of.</p>

<p>In the interpretation of τεταγμένοι ὥσπερ ἔμελλον, I agree with
the Scholiast, who understands μαχέσασθαι or μαχεῖσθαι after ἔμελλον
(compare Thucyd. v, 66), dissenting from Dr. Arnold and Göller, who
would understand τάσσεσθαι; which, as it seems to me, makes a very
awkward meaning, and is not sustained by the passage produced as
parallel (viii, 51).</p>

<p>The infinitive verb, understood after ἔμελλον, need not
necessarily be a verb actually occurring before: it may be a verb
suggested by the general scope of the sentence: see ἐμέλλησαν, iv,
123.</p>

<p>In particular, they do not take notice that it is the <i>Athenian</i>

what is Bœotian: and that he defines Athenian territory to be that

the philosopher superhuman gallantry.</p>

formed by the junction of the Apidanus and Enipeus. See Kiepert’s

<p>We must suppose that Brasidas was detained a considerable time in
parleying with the opposing band of Thessalians. Otherwise, it would
seem that the space between Melitæa and Pharsalus would not be a
great distance to get over in an entire day’s march, considering that
the pace was as rapid as the troops could sustain. The much greater
distance between Larissa and Melitæa, was traversed in one night by
Philip king of Macedon, the son of Demetrius, with an army carrying
ladders and other aids for attacking a town, etc. (Polyb. v, 97.)</p>

<p>Bekker’s reading of πρὸ ἕω appears to me preferable to πρόσω. The

<p>Dr. Arnold, with Dobree, Poppo, and most of the commentators,

had to cross the river to reach the town. Smith and Bloomfield are
right, I think, in considering τῆς διαβάσεως as governed by ἀπέχει
and not by πλέον,—“the city is at some distance from the crossing:”
and the objection which Poppo makes against them, that πλέον must
necessarily imply a comparison with something, cannot be sustained:
for Thucydidês often uses ἐκ πλείονος (iv, 103; viii, 83), as
precisely identical with ἐκ πολλοῦ (i, 68; iv, 67; v, 69); also περὶ

occasion with what is generally given (Hist. of Greece, ch. xxiii,
vol. iii, p. 268).</p>

<p>“On the evening of the same day Thucydidês, with seven galleys
which he happened to have with him at Thasos, when he received the
despatch from Euklês, sailed into the mouth of the Strymon, and
learning the fall of Amphipolis proceeded to put Eion in a state
of defence. His timely arrival saved the place, which Brasidas
attacked the next morning, both from the river and the land, without
effect: and the refugees who retired by virtue of the treaty from
Amphipolis, found shelter at Eion, and contributed to its security.
<i>The historian rendered an important service to his country: and
it does not appear that human prudence and activity could have
accomplished anything more under the same circumstances.</i> Yet <i>his
unavoidable failure</i> proved the occasion of a sentence, under which
he spent twenty years of his life in exile: and he was only restored
to his country in the season of her deepest humiliation by the
public calamities. So much only can be gathered with certainty from
his language: for he has not condescended to mention either the
charge which was brought against him, or the nature of the sentence,
which he may either have suffered, or avoided by a voluntary exile.
A statement, very probable in itself, though resting on slight
authority, attributes his banishment to Cleon’s calumnies: <i>that the
irritation produced by the loss of Amphipolis should have been so
directed against an innocent object, would perfectly accord with the
character of the people and of the demagogue</i>. Posterity has gained
by the injustice of his contemporaries,” etc.</p>

<p>Here Thucydidês describes himself as “the other general along
with Euklês, of the region of or towards Thrace.” There cannot be
a clearer designation of the extensive range of his functions and
duties.</p>

<p>I adopt here the reading τῶν ἐπὶ Θρᾴκης, the genitive case of the
well-known Thucydidean phrase τὰ ἐπὶ Θρᾴκης, in preference to τὸν
ἐπὶ Θρᾴκης; which would mean in substance the same thing, though not
so precisely, nor so suitably to the usual manner of the historian.
Bloomfield, Bekker, and Göller have all introduced τῶν into the
text, on the authority of various MSS.: Poppo and Dr. Arnold also
both express a preference for it, though they still leave τὸν in the
text.</p>

<p>Moreover, the words of Thucydidês himself, in the passage where
he mentions his own long exile, plainly prove that he was sent out
as general, not to Thasos, but <i>to Amphipolis</i>: (v, 26) καὶ ξυνέβη

<p>Rotscher, in his Life of Thucydidês (Leben des Thukydides,

truth, that Thucydidês was selected for this command expressly in
consequence of his private influence in the region around. Yet this
biographer still repeats the view generally taken, that Thucydidês
did everything which an able commander could do, and was most
unjustly condemned.</p>

τῶν μὲν στέρεσθαι, τοῖς δ᾽ ἐκ τοῦ ἴσου ἀμυνόμενοι κινδυνεύειν καὶ
κρατήσειν.</p>

<p>This is a perplexing passage, and the sense put upon it by the
best commentators appears to me unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>Dr. Arnold observes: “The sense required must be something of this
sort. If Brasidas were still more successful, the consequence would
be that they would lose their men taken at Sphakteria, and after all
would run the risk of not being finally victorious.” To the same
purpose, substantially Haack, Poppo, Göller, etc. But surely this is
a meaning which cannot have been present to the mind of Thucydidês.
For how could the fact, of Brasidas being <i>more successful</i>, cause
the Lacedæmonians to lose the chance of regaining their prisoners?
The larger the acquisitions of Brasidas, the greater chance did the
Lacedæmonians stand of getting back their prisoners, because they
would have more to give up in exchange for them. And the meaning
proposed by the commentators, inadmissible under all circumstances,
is still more excluded by the very words immediately preceding in
Thucydidês: “The Lacedæmonians were above all things anxious to
get back their prisoners, while Brasidas was yet in full success;”
(for ὡς with ἔτι must mean substantially the same as ἕως.) It is
impossible immediately after this, that he can go on to say: “Yet
if Brasidas became <i>still more successful</i>, they would <i>lose</i> the
chance of getting the prisoners back.” Bauer and Poppo, who notice
this contradiction, profess to solve it by saying, “that if Brasidas
pushed his successes farther, the Athenians would be seized with
such violence of hatred and indignation, that they would put the
prisoners to death.” Poppo supports this by appealing to iv, 41,
which passage, however, will be found to carry no proof in the case:
and the hypothesis is in itself inadmissible, put up to sustain an
inadmissible meaning.</p>

<p>Next, as to the words ἀντίπαλα καταστήσαντος (ἐπὶ μεῖζον
χωρήσαντος αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀντίπαλα καταστήσαντος); Göller translates
these: “Postquam Brasidas in majus profecisset, et <i>sua arma cum
potestate Atheniensium æquasset</i>.” To the same purpose also Haack and
Poppo. But if this were the meaning, it would seem to imply, that
Brasidas had, as yet, done nothing and gained nothing; that his gains
were all to be made during the future. Whereas the fact is distinctly
the reverse, as Thucydidês himself has told us in the line preceding:
Brasidas had already made immense acquisitions,—so great and serious,
that the principal anxiety of the Lacedæmonians was to make use
of what he had already gained as a means of getting back their
prisoners, before the tide of fortune could turn against him.</p>

<p>Again, the last part of the sentence is considered by Dr. Arnold
and other commentators as corrupt; nor is it agreed to what previous
subject τοῖς δὲ is intended to refer.</p>

<p>So inadmissible, in my judgment, is the meaning assigned by the
commentators to the general passage, that, if no other meaning could
be found in the words, I should regard the whole sentence as corrupt
in some way or other. But I think another meaning may be found.</p>

<p>I admit that the words ἐπὶ μεῖζον χωρήσαντος αὐτοῦ <i>might</i>
signify, “if he should arrive at greater success;” upon the analogy
of i, 17, and i, 118, ἐπὶ πλεῖστον ἐχώρησαν δυνάμεως—ἐπὶ μέγα
ἐχώρησαν δυνάμεως. But they do not necessarily, nor even naturally,
bear this signification. Χωρεῖν ἐπὶ (with accus. case) means to
<i>march upon</i>, to <i>aim at</i>, to <i>go at</i> or <i>go for</i> (adopting an
English colloquial equivalent), ἐχώρουν ἐπὶ τὴν ἀντικρὺς ἐλευθερίαν
(Thucyd. viii, 64). The phrase might be used, whether the person of
whom it was affirmed succeeded in his object or not. I conceive that
in this place the words mean: “if Brasidas should go at something
greater;” if he should aim at, “or march upon, greater objects;”
without affirming the point, one way or the other, whether he would
attain or miss what he aimed at.</p>

<p>Next, the words ἀντίπαλα καταστήσαντος do not refer, in my
judgment, to the future gains of Brasidas, or to their magnitude
and comparative avail in negotiation. The words rather mean: “if
he should set out in open contest and hostility that which he
had already acquired,” (thus exposing it to the chance of being
lost), “if he should put himself and his already-acquired gains
in battle-front against the enemy.” The meaning would be then
substantially the same as καταστήσαντος ἑαυτὸν ἀντίπαλον. The two
words here discussed are essentially obscure and elliptical, and
every interpretation must proceed by bringing into light those ideas
which they imperfectly indicate. Now, the interpretation which I
suggest keeps quite as closely to the meaning of the two words as
that of Haack and Göller; while it brings out a general sense, making
the whole sentence, of which these two words form a part, distinct
and instructive. The substantive, which would be understood along
with ἀντίπαλα, would be τὰ πράγματα; or perhaps τὰ εὐτυχήματα,
borrowed from the verb εὐτύχει, which immediately precedes.</p>

<p>In the latter part of the sentence, I think that τοῖς δὲ refers
to the same subject as ἀντίπαλα: in fact, ἀπὸ τοῦ ἴσου ἀμυνόμενοι is
only a fuller expression of the same general idea as ἀντίπαλα.</p>

<p>The whole sentence would then be construed thus: “For they were
most anxious to recover their captives while Brasidas was yet in good
fortune; while they were likely, if he should go at more, and put
himself as he now stood into hostile contention, to remain deprived
of their captives; and even in regard to their successes, to take the
chance of danger or victory in equal conflict.”</p>

<p>The sense here brought out is distinct and rational; and I think
it lies fairly in the words. Thucydidês does not intend to represent
the Lacedæmonians as feeling, that if Brasidas should <i>really gain</i>
more than he had gained already, such further acquisition would
be a disadvantage to them, and prevent them from recovering their
captives. He represents them as preferring <i>the certainty</i> of those
acquisitions which Brasidas had already made, to <i>the chance and
hazard</i> of his aiming at greater; which could not be done without
endangering that which was now secure, and not only secure, but
sufficient, if properly managed, to procure the restoration of the
captives.</p>

<p>Poppo refers τοῖς δὲ to the Athenians: Göller refers it to the
remaining Spartan military force, apart from the captives who were
detained at Athens. The latter reference seems to me inadmissible,
for τοῖς δὲ must signify some persons or things which have been
before specified or indicated; and that which Göller supposes it to
mean has not been before indicated. To refer it to the Athenians,
with Poppo and Haack, in his second edition, we should have to look a
great way back for the subject, and there is, moreover, a difficulty
in construing ἀμυνόμενοι with the dative case. Otherwise, this
reference would be admissible; though I think it better to refer
τοῖς δὲ to the same subject as ἀντίπαλα. In the phrase κινδυνεύειν,
or κινδυνεύσειν, for there seems no sufficient reason why this old
reading should be altered, <em class="gesperrt">καὶ</em> κρατήσειν,
the particle <em class="gesperrt">καὶ</em> has a disjunctive sense,
of which there are analogous examples; see Kühner, Griechische
Grammmatik, sect. 726, signifying, substantially, the same as ἢ:
and examples even in Thucydidês, in such phrases as τοιαῦτα καὶ
παραπλήσια (i, 22, 143), τοιαύτη καὶ ὅτι ἐγγύτατα τούτων, v, 74; see

possible clearly to understand this passage without some knowledge
of the ground to which it refers. I presume that the regular road
through the defile, along which the main army of Brasidas passed,
was long and winding, making the ascent to the top very gradual, but
at the same time exposed on both sides from the heights above. The
detachment of three hundred scaled the steep heights on one side, and
drove away the enemy, thus making it impossible for him to remain any
longer even in the main road. But I do not suppose, with Dr. Arnold,
that the main army of Brasidas followed the three hundred, and “broke
out of the valley by scaling one of its sides:” they pursued the main
road, as soon as it was cleared for them.</p>

<p id="Footnote_717"><span class="label"><a

ἐκ Σπάρτης, ὥστε τῶν πόλεων ἄρχοντας καθιστάναι καὶ μὴ <em
class="gesperrt">τοῖς ἐντυχοῦσιν</em> ἐπιτρέπειν.</p>

<p>Most of the commentators translate ἡβώντων, “<i>young men</i>,” which
is not the usual meaning of the word: it signifies, “<i>men of military
age</i>,” which includes both young and middle-aged. If we compare iv,
132 with iii, 36, v, 32, and v, 116, we shall see that ἡβῶντες really
has this larger meaning: compare also μέχρι ἥβης (ii, 46), which
means, “until the age of military service commenced.”</p>

<p>It is not therefore necessary to suppose that the men taken out by
Ischagoras were very young, for example that they were below the age
of thirty, as Manso, O. Müller, and Göller would have us believe. It
is enough that they were within the limits of the military age, both
ways.</p>

<p>Considering the extraordinary reverence paid to old age at Sparta,
it is by no means wonderful that old men should have been thought
exclusively fitted for such commands, in the ancient customs and
constitution.</p>

<p>The extensive operations, however, in which Sparta became involved
through the Peloponnesian war, would render it impossible to maintain
such a maxim in practice: but at this moment, the step was still
recognized as a departure from a received maxim, and is characterized
as such by Thucydidês under the term παρανόμως.</p>

<p>I explain τοῖς ἐντυχοῦσιν to refer to the case of men <i>not
Spartans</i> being named to these posts: see in reference to this point,
the stress which Brasidas lays on the fact that Klearidas was a
Spartan, Thucyd. v, 9.</p>

ii, 17, 7; iii, 5, 6. Hellanikus (a contemporary of Thucydidês, but
somewhat older, coming in point of age between him and Herodotus)
had framed a chronological series of these priestesses of Hêrê, with
a history of past events belonging to the supposed times of each.
And such was the Pan-Hellenic importance of the temple at this time,
that Thucydidês, when he describes accurately the beginning of the
Peloponnesian war, tells us, as one of his indications of time, that
Chrysis had then been forty-eight years priestess at the Heræum.
To employ the series of Olympic prize-runners and Olympiads as a

<p id="Footnote_722"><span class="label"><a

reasonable sense to put upon the much-debated passage of Thucyd. v,
1. Τοῦ δ᾽ ἐπιγιγνομένου θέρους αἱ μὲν ἐνιαύσιοι σπονδαὶ διελέλυντο
μέχρι τῶν Πυθίων· καὶ ἐν τῇ <em class="gesperrt">ἐκεχειρίᾳ</em>
Ἀθηναῖοι Δηλίους ἀνέστησαν ἐκ Δήλου; again, v, 2. Κλέων δὲ
Ἀθηναίους πείσας ἐς τὰ ἐπὶ Θρᾴκης χωρία ἐξέπλευσε μετὰ τὴν <em
class="gesperrt">ἐκεχειρίαν</em>, etc.</p>

<p>Thucydidês says here, that “the truce was dissolved:” the bond
imposed upon both parties was untied, and both resumed their natural
liberty. But he does not say that “<i>hostilities recommenced</i>” before
the Pythia, as Göller and other critics affirm that he says. The
interval between the 14th of the month Elaphebolion and the Pythian
festival was one in which there was no binding truce any longer in
force, and yet no actual hostilities: it was an ἀνακωχὴ ἄσπονδος, to
use the words of Thucydidês, when he describes the relations between
Corinth and Athens in the ensuing year (v, 32).</p>

<p>The word ἐκεχειρία here means, in my judgment, the truce
proclaimed at the season of the Pythian festival,—quite distinct
from the truce for one year which had expired a little while before.
The change of the word in the course of one line from σπονδαὶ to
ἐκεχειρία marks this distinction.</p>

<p>I agree with Dr. Arnold, dissenting both from M. Boeckh and from
Mr. Clinton, in his conception of the events of this year. Kleon
sailed on his expedition to Thrace after the Pythian holy truce, in
the beginning of August: between that date and the end of September,
happened the capture of Torônê and the battle of Amphipolis. But
the way in which Dr. Arnold defends his opinion is not at all
satisfactory. In the Dissertation appended to his second volume of
Thucydidês (p. 458), he says: “The words in Thucydidês αἱ ἐνιαύσιοι
σπονδαὶ διελέλυντο μέχρι Πυθίων, mean, as I understand them, ‘that
the truce for a year had <i>lasted on</i> till the Pythian games, and then
ended:’ that is, instead of expiring on the 14th of Elaphebolion, it
had been <i>tacitly continued</i> nearly four months longer, till after
midsummer: and it was not till the middle of Hekatombæon that Cleon
was sent out to recover Amphipolis.”</p>

<p>Such a construction of the word διελέλυντο appears to me
inadmissible, nor is Dr. Arnold’s defence of it, p. 454, of much
value: σπονδὰς διαλύειν is an expression well known to Thucydidês
(iv, 23; v, 36), “to dissolve the truce.” I go along with Boeckh and
Mr. Clinton in construing the words, except that I strike out what
they introduce from their own imagination. They say: “The truce was
ended, and <i>the war again renewed</i>, up to the time of the Pythian
games.” Thucydidês only says “that the truce was dissolved;” he does
not say “<i>that the war was renewed</i>.” It is not at all necessary
to Dr. Arnold’s conception of the facts that the words should be
translated as he proposes. His remarks also (p. 460) upon the
relation of the Athenians to the Pythian games, appear to me just:
but he does not advert to the fact, which would have strengthened
materially what he there says, that the Athenians had been excluded
from Delphi and from the Pythian festival between the commencement
of the war and the one year’s truce. I conceive that the Pythian
games were celebrated about July or August. In an earlier part of
this History (ch. xxviii, vol. iv, p. 67), I said that they were
celebrated in <i>autumn</i>; it ought rather to be “towards the end of
summer.”</p>

<p>I annex a plan which will convey some idea of the hill of
Amphipolis and the circumjacent territory: compare the plan in
Colonel Leake, Travels in Northern Greece, vol. iii, ch. xxv, p.
191, and that from Mr. Hawkins, which is annexed to the third volume
of Dr. Arnold’s Thucydidês, combined with a Dissertation which
appears in the second volume of the same work, p. 450. See also the
remarks in Kutzen, De Atheniensium imperio circa Strymonem, ch.
ii, pp. 18-21; Weissenborn, Beiträge zur genaueren Erforschung der
alt-griechischen Geschichte, pp. 152-156; Cousinéry, Voyage dans la
Macédoine, vol. i, ch. iv, p. 124, <i>seq.</i></p>

<p>Colonel Leake supposes the ancient bridge to have been at the
same point of the river as the modern bridge; that is, north of
Amphipolis, and a little westward of the corner of the lake. On this
point I differ from him, and have placed it, with Dr. Arnold, near
the southeastern end of the reach of the Strymon, which flows round
Amphipolis. But there is another circumstance, in which Col. Leake’s
narrative corrects a material error in Dr. Arnold’s Dissertation.
Colonel Leake particularly notices the high ridge which connects the
hill of Amphipolis with Mount Pangæus to the eastward (pp. 182, 183,
191-194), whereas Dr. Arnold represents them as separated by a deep
ravine (p. 451): upon which latter supposition the whole account of
Kleon’s march and survey appears to me unintelligible.</p>

<p>The epithet which Thucydidês gives to Amphipolis, “conspicuous
both towards the sea and towards the land,” which occasions some
perplexity to the commentators, appears to me one of obvious
propriety. Amphipolis was indeed situated on a hill; so were many
other towns: but its peculiarity was, that on three sides it had no
wall to interrupt the eye of the spectator: one of those sides was
towards the sea.</p>

<p>Kutzen and Cousinéry make the long wall to be the segment of a
curve highly bent, touching the river at both ends. But I agree with
Weissenborn that this is inadmissible; and that the words “long wall”
imply something near a straight direction.</p>

upon these words. This does not necessarily imply that the bridge was
at any considerable distance from the extreme point where the long
wall touched the river to the south: but this latter point was a good
way off from the town properly so called, which occupied the higher
slope of the hill. We are not to suppose that the <i>whole</i> space
between the long wall and the river was covered by buildings.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_735"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_735">[735]</a></span> Thucyd. v. 10. Καὶ ὁ μὲν
(Brasidas) κατὰ τὰς ἐπὶ τὸ σταύρωμα πύλας, καὶ τὰς πρώτας τοῦ μακροῦ
τείχους τότε ὄντος ἐξελθὼν, ἔθει δρόμῳ τὴν ὁδὸν ταύτην εὐθεῖαν, ᾗπερ
νῦν, etc.</p>

<p>The explanation which I have here given to the word σταύρωμα
is not given by any one else; but it appears to me the only one
calculated to impart clearness and consistency to the whole
narrative.</p>

<p>When Brasidas surprised Amphipolis first, the bridge was
completely unconnected with the Long Wall, and at a certain distance
from it. But when Thucydidês wrote his history, there were a pair
of <i>connecting walls</i> between the bridge and the fortifications of
the city as they then stood—οὐ καθεῖτο τείχη ὥσπερ νῦν (iv, 103):
the whole fortifications of the city had been altered during the
intermediate period.</p>

<p>Now the question is, was the Long Wall of Amphipolis connected
or unconnected with the bridge, at the time of the conflict between
Brasidas and Kleon? Whoever reads the narrative of Thucydidês
attentively will see, I think, that they must have been connected,
though Thucydidês does not in express terms specify the fact. For
if the bridge had been detached from the wall, as it was when
Brasidas surprised the place first, the hill of Kerdylium on the
opposite side of the river would have been an unsafe position for
him to occupy. He might have been cut off from Amphipolis by an
enemy attacking the bridge. But we shall find him remaining quietly
on the hill of Kerdylium with the perfect certainty of entering
Amphipolis at any moment that he chose. If it be urged that the
bridge, though unconnected with the Long Wall, might still be under
a strong separate guard, I reply, that on that supposition an enemy
from Eion would naturally attack the bridge first. To have to defend
a bridge completely detached from the city, simply by means of a
large constant guard, would materially aggravate the difficulties of
Brasidas. If it had been possible to attack the bridge separately
from the city, something must have been said about it in describing
the operations of Kleon, who is represented as finding nothing to
meddle with except the fortifications of the town.</p>

<p>Assuming, then, that there was such a line of connection between
the bridge and the Long Wall, added by Brasidas since the first
capture of the place, I know no meaning so natural to give to the
word σταύρωμα. No other distinct meaning is proposed by any one.
There was, of course, a gate, or more than one, in the Long Wall,
leading into the space inclosed by the palisade; through this gate
Brasidas would enter the town when he crossed from Kerdylium. This
gate is called by Thucydidês αἱ ἐπὶ τὸ σταύρωμα πύλαι. There must
have been also a gate, or more than one, in the palisade itself,
leading into the space without: so that passengers or cattle
traversing the bridge from the westward and going to Myrkinus (<i>e.
g.</i>) would not necessarily be obliged to turn out of their way and
enter the town of Amphipolis.</p>

<p>On the plan which I have here given, the line running nearly
from north to south represents the Long Wall of Agnon, touching the
river at both ends, and bounding as well as fortifying the town of
Amphipolis on its eastern side.</p>

<p>The shorter line, which cuts off the southern extremity of
this Long Wall, and joins the river immediately below the bridge,
represents the σταύρωμα, or palisade: probably it was an earthen
mound and ditch, with a strong palisade at the top.</p>

<p>By means of this palisade, the bridge was included in the
fortifications of Amphipolis, and Brasidas could pass over from Mount
Kerdylium into the city whenever he pleased.</p>

κύκλῳ περιστὰς βίᾳ αἱρήσων τὴν πόλιν.</p>

<p>The words οὐχ ὡς τῷ ἀσφαλεῖ, etc. do not refer to μείζω
παρασκευὴν, as the Scholiast, with whom Dr. Arnold agrees, considers
them, but to the general purpose and dispositions of Kleon. “He
marched up, not like one who is abundantly provided with means of
safety, in case of being put on his defence; but like one who is
going to surround the city and take it at once.”</p>

<p>Nor do these last words represent any real design conceived in the
mind of Kleon (for Amphipolis from its locality <i>could not be really
surrounded</i>), but are merely given as illustrating the careless
confidence of his march from Eion up to the ridge: in the same manner
as Herodotus describes the forward rush of the Persians before
the battle of Platæa, to overtake the Greeks whom they supposed
to be running away—Καὶ οὗτοι μὲν βοῇ τε καὶ ὁμίλῳ ἐπήισαν, ὡς <em

ὅτι οὐκ κατῆλθεν ἔχων, ἁμαρτεῖν ἐδόκει· ἑλεῖν γὰρ ἂν τὴν πόλιν διὰ τὸ

<p>I apprehend that the verb κατῆλθεν refers to the coming
of the armament to Eion: analogous to what is said v, 2, <em
class="gesperrt">κατέπλευσεν</em> ἐς τὸν Τορωναίων λιμένα: compare i,
51; iii, 4, etc. The march from Eion up to the ridge could not well
be expressed by the word κατῆλθεν: but the arrival of the expedition
at the Strymon, the place of its destination, might be so described.
Battering-engines would be brought from nowhere else but from
Athens.</p>

<p>Dr. Arnold interprets the word κατῆλθεν to mean that Kleon
had first marched up to a higher point, and then descended from
this point upon Amphipolis. But I contest the correctness of this
assumption, as a matter of topography: it does not appear to me that
Kleon ever reached any point higher than the summit of the hill
and wall of Amphipolis. Besides, even if he had reached a higher
point of the mountain, he could not well talk of “bringing down
battering-machines <i>from that point</i>.”</p>

<p>The words τὸ ἀνειμένον τῆς γνώμης are full of significance in
regard to ancient military affairs. The Grecian hoplites, even the
best of them, required to be peculiarly <i>wound up</i> for a battle;
hence the necessity of the harangue from the general which always
preceded. Compare Xenophon’s eulogy of the manœuvres of Epameinondas
before the battle of Mantineia, whereby he made the enemy fancy that
he was not going to fight, and took down the preparation in the minds
of their soldiers for battle: ἔλυσε μὲν τῶν πλείστων πολεμίων τὴν

<p>Brasidas and his men sallied forth by two different gates at the
same time. One was the first gate in the Long Wall, which would be
the first gate in order, to a person coming from the southward. The
other was the <i>gate upon the palisade</i> (αἱ ἐπὶ τὸ σταύρωμα πύλαι),
that is, the gate in the Long Wall which opened <i>from the town upon
the palisade</i>. The persons who sallied out by this gate would get out
to attack the enemy by the gate in the palisade itself.</p>

<p>The gate in the Long Wall which opened from the town upon the
palisade, would be that by which Brasidas himself with his army
entered Amphipolis from Mount Kerdylium. It probably stood open at
this moment when he directed the sally forth: that which had to be
opened at the moment, was the gate in the palisade, together with the
first gate in the Long Wall.</p>

<p>The last words cited in Thucydidês—ᾗπερ νῦν κατὰ τὸ καρτερώτατον
τοῦ χωρίου ἰόντι τὸ τροπαῖον ἕστηκε—are not intelligible without
better knowledge of the topography than we possess. What Thucydidês
means by “the strongest point in the place,” we cannot tell. We only
understand that the trophy was erected in the road by which a person
went up to that point. We must recollect that the expressions of
Thucydidês here refer to the ground as it stood sometime afterwards,
not as it stood at the time of the battle between Kleon and
Brasidas.</p>

Amphipolis, when one’s mind is full of the distinct and admirable
narrative of Thucydidês, only defective by being too brief. It is
difficult to believe that Diodorus is describing the same event;
so totally different are all the circumstances, except that the
Lacedæmonians at last gain the victory. To say, with Wesseling in his
note, “Hæc <i>non usquequaque</i> conveniunt Thucydideis,” is prodigiously

fortifications of the place seem to have been materially altered
during the interval. Instead of one long wall, with three sides open
to the river, it seems to have acquired a curved wall, only open to
the river on a comparatively narrow space near to the lake; while
this curved wall joined the bridge southerly by means of a parallel

href="#FNanchor_757">[757]</a></span> The public speaking of Kleon
was characterized by Aristotle and Theopompus (see Schol. ad Lucian.
Timon, c. 30), not as wheedling, but as full of arrogance; in this
latter point too like that of the elder Cato at Rome (Plutarch,
Cato, c. 14). The derisory tone of Cato in his public speaking, too,
is said to have been impertinent and disgusting (Plutarch, Reipub.
Gerend. Præcept. p. 803, c. 7).</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_758"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_758">[758]</a></span> An epigram which Plutarch
(Cato, c. 1) gives us from a poet contemporary of Cato the Censor,
describes him:—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Πυῤῥὸν, <em class="gesperrt">πανδακέτην</em>, γλαυκόμματον, οὐδὲ θανόντα</p>
<p class="i2">Πόρκιον εἰς Ἀΐδην Περσεφόνη δέχεται.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="mt1">Livy says, in an eloquent encomium on Cato (xxxix,
40): “Simultates nimio plures et exercuerunt eum, et ipse exercuit
eas: nec facile dixeris utrum magis presserit eum nobilitas, an ille
agitaverit nobilitatem. Asperi procul dubio animi, et linguæ acerbæ
et immodice liberæ fuit: sed invicti a cupiditatibus animi et rigidæ
innocentiæ: contemptor gratiæ, divitiarum.... Hunc sicut omni vitâ,
tum censuram petentem premebat nobilitas; coierantque candidati omnes
ad dejiciendum honore eum; non solum ut ipsi potius adipiscerentur,
nec quia indignabantur novum hominem censorem videre; sed etiam
quod tristem censuram, periculosamque multorum famæ, et <i>ab læso a
plerisque et lædendi cupido</i>, expectabant.”</p>

<p>See also Plutarch (Cato, c. 15, 16: his comparison between
Aristeidês and Cato, c. 2) about the prodigious number of accusations
in which Cato was engaged, either as prosecutor or as party
prosecuted. His bitter feud with the <i>nobilitas</i> is analogous to that
of Kleon against the Hippeis.</p>

<p>I need hardly say that the comparison of Cato with Kleon applies
only to domestic politics: in the military courage and energy for
which Cato was distinguished, Kleon is utterly wanting, nor are we
entitled to ascribe to him anything like the superiority of knowledge
and general intelligence which we find recorded of Cato.</p>

<p>The expression of Cicero respecting Kleon: “turbulentum quidem
civem, sed tamen eloquentem,” (Cicero, Brutus, 7) appears to be
a translation of the epithets of Thucydidês—βιαιότατος—τῷ δήμῳ
πιθανώτατος (iii, 45).</p>

<p>The remarks made too by Latin critics on the style and temper of
Cato’s speeches, might almost seem to be a translation of the words
of Thucydidês about Kleon. Fronto said about Cato: “Concionatur Cato
<i>infeste</i>, Gracchus turbulente, Tullius copiose. Jam in judiciis
<i>sævit</i> idem Cato, triumphat Cicero, tumultuatur Gracchus.” See
Dübner’s edition of Meyer’s Oratorum Romanorum Fragmenta, p. 117
(Paris, 1837).</p>

elder represented as constantly in the forum at Rome, lending aid
of this kind, and espousing the cause of others who had grounds of
complaint (Plutarch, Cato, c. 3), πρωῒ μὲν εἰς ἀγορὰν βαδίζει καὶ

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_763"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_763">[763]</a></span> It appears that the complaint
was made ostensibly against Kalistratus, in whose name the poet
brought out the “Babylonians,” (Schol. ad Arist. Vesp. 1284), and
who was of course the responsible party, though the real author
was doubtless perfectly well known. The Knights was the first play
brought out by the poet in his own name.</p>

href="#FNanchor_764">[764]</a></span> See Acharn. 377, with the
Scholia, and the anonymous biography of Aristophanês.</p>

<p>Both Meineke (Aristoph. Fragm. Comic. Gr. vol. ii, p. 966) and
Ranke (Commentat. de Aristoph. Vitâ, p. cccxxx) try to divine the
plot of the “Babylonians;” but there is no sufficient information to
assist them.</p>

href="#FNanchor_766">[766]</a></span> See the Arguments prefixed to
these three plays; and Acharn. 475, Equit. 881.</p>

<p>It is not known whether the first comedy, entitled <i>The Clouds</i>
(represented in the earlier part of <small>B.C.</small>
423, a year after the Knights, and a year before the Wasps), appeared
at the Lenæan festival of January, or at the urban Dionysia in
March. It was unsuccessful, and the poet partially altered it with
the view to a second representation. If it be true that this second
representation took place during the year immediately following
(<small>B.C.</small> 422: see Mr. Clinton’s Fasti
Hellenici, ad ann. 422), it must have been at the urban Dionysia in
March, just at the time when the truce for one year was coming to
a close; for the Wasps was represented in that year at the Lenæan
festival, and the same poet would hardly be likely to bring out two
plays. The inference which Ranke draws from Nubes 310, that it was
represented at the Dionysia, is not, however, very conclusive (Ranke,
Commentat. de Aristoph. Vitâ, p. ccxxi, prefixed to his edition of
the Plutus).</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_767"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_767">[767]</a></span> See the obscure passage,
Vespæ, 1285, <i>seqq.</i>; Aristoph. Vita Anonymi, p. xiii, ed. Bekker;
Demosthen. cont. Meid. p. 532.</p>

<p>It appears that Aristophanês was of Æginetan parentage (Acharn.
629); so that the γραφὴ ξενίας (indictment for undue assumption
of the rights of an Athenian citizen) was founded upon a real
fact. Between the time of the conquest of Ægina by Athens, and
the expulsion of the native inhabitants in the first year of the
Peloponnesian war (an interval of about twenty years), probably
no inconsiderable number of Æginetans became intermingled or
intermarried with Athenian citizens. Especially men of poetical
talent in the subject-cities would find it their interest to repair
to Athens: Ion came from Chios, and Achæus from Eretria; both tragic
composers.</p>

<p>The comic author Eupolis seems also to have directed some taunts
against the foreign origin of Aristophanês, if Meineke is correct
in his interpretation of a passage (Historia Comicor. Græc. i, p.
111).</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_768"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_768">[768]</a></span> Thucyd. v, 17-30. The statement
in cap. 30 seems to show that this was the ground on which the
Athenians were allowed to retain Sollium and Anaktorium. For if their
retention of these two places had been distinctly and in terms at
variance with the treaty, the Corinthians would doubtless have chosen
this fact as the ostensible ground of their complaint: whereas they
preferred to have recourse to a πρόσχημα, or sham plea.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_769"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_769">[769]</a></span> Compare v, 39 with v, 18, which
seems to me to refute the explanation suggested by Dr. Arnold, and
adopted by Poppo.</p>

<p>The use of the word ἀποδόντων in regard to the restoration of
Amphipolis to Athens, and of the word παρέδοσαν in regard to the
<i>relinquishment</i> of the other cities, deserves notice. Those who drew
up the treaty, which is worded in a very confused way, seem to have
intended that the word παρέδοσαν should apply both to Amphipolis
and the other cities, but that the word ἀποδόντων should apply
exclusively to Amphipolis. The word παρέδοσαν is of course applicable
to the restoration of Amphipolis, for that which is <i>restored</i>
is of course <i>delivered up</i>. But it is remarkable that this word
παρέδοσαν does not properly apply to the other cities: for they were
not <i>delivered up</i> to Athens, they were only <i>relinquished</i>, as the
clauses immediately following farther explain. Perhaps there is a
little Athenian pride in the use of the word, first to intimate
indirectly that the Lacedæmonians were to <i>deliver up</i> various cities
to Athens, then to add words afterwards, which show that the cities
were only to be <i>relinquished</i>, not surrendered to Athens.</p>

<p>The provision, for guaranteeing liberty of retirement and
carrying away of property, was of course intended chiefly for the
Amphipolitans, who would naturally desire to emigrate, if the town
had been actually restored to Athens.</p>

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
